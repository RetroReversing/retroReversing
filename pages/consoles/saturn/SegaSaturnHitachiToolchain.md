## Dwarf Converter (DWFCNV.exe)

```

## SHC (shc.exe)
SHC is the C compile provided for the SH processors by Hitachi.

# Hitachi Libraries

Name | Description
---|---
SHCNPIC.LIB  | Library not compatible with position-independent code for SH7600 
 

## LBR (Librarian)
The Hitachi Librarian is used for creating and modifying static library files `.lib`, possibly in SYSROF format.

---
# ABS Files
ABS files are the compiled and linked form of the Sega Saturn same programs compiled with the hitachi toolchain.

The format could be SYSROF:
File Header: 80 21 00 80

Seems to contain OBJ files, possibly similar to COFF or ELF in concept but a completely different format.

## SYSROF object module format
Where is the spec for the SYSROF object module format?


### SysRof in dreamcast
There are a few hints that sysrof and the Hitachi compiler are used for dreamcast development such as Scream Dreamcast game: [Scream/Makefile at 62fbf14bb46ea9f6b7cf5a34078d7a81214cbd6e Â· RedRingRico/Scream](https://github.com/RedRingRico/Scream/blob/62fbf14bb46ea9f6b7cf5a34078d7a81214cbd6e/Source/Makefile)
