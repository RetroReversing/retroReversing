If you are interested in reversing a Sega Saturn game it can be useful to see what other platforms the game was released for, however if you don't have a game in mind then this list can help you choose a game that is not available elsewhere.

By reverse engineering these games you are helping to preserve games that are only playable on Sega Saturn, so you can understand how these games work and then help improve emulators to run these games.
