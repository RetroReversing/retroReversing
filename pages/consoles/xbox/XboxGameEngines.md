# Introduction
When the Xbox came out in 2001 most game developers were still getting used to the new layer of abstractions and code re-use provided by the superior hardware of consoles compared to the previous generations.

Game engines have always been used to a certain extent within the games industry for re-using code from one game to another.

These game engines were normally just distributed to developers in the same company and never released to other development studios therefore these are called 'in-house' game engines.

However the Xbox generation was the first to really take 3rd party game engines seriously. 

Full commercial off-the-shelf game engines became much more popular such as Unreal Engine or GameBryo. 

But the real winners were the more specific middleware libraries such as the **Havok** Physics engine, **Bink** Video Playback engine and the **Renderware** Graphics engine.

Most developers still wanted full control over their game engine but it was too costly to write a custom physics, audio or video engine for each game. In future console generations developers would move towards the full game engines, leaving some of the flexibility behind.

## Detecting Middleware and Game Engines in Xbox Games
The games listed below each engine or middleware have been confirmed to use those engines by searching for common strings within the Xbox executable themselves. 

If you would like to add a game to the list please make sure to check the executable for a trace of the code, sometimes developers aim to use a library but it never ends up in the final build.

# Full Retail Game Engines
These engines were sold to developers as a product as opposed to 'in-house' engines that were only used by one company.

## Unreal Engine
<section class="postSection">
<img src="/public/images/engines/UnrealEngineLogo.png" style="width:inherit;" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" />
<div markdown="1">
The Unreal Engine was developed by [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/) initially for their game `Unreal` but later evolved to become a product in itself with many 3rd party games studios taking advantage of its power.

To find out if your games uses this engine, look for a file with a .umd extension for example `xboxship.umd`. Or search the files for the string `UnrealEd`.

Games:
* America's Army - Rise of a Soldier
* Brother in Arms
* Brother in Arms: Earned in Blood
* Combat Task Force 121
* Dead Man's Hand
* Deus Ex Invisible War
* Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
* Land of the Dead
* Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds
* Men of Valor
* New Legends
* Open Season
* Pariah
* Rainbow Six 3
* Rainbow Six 3 - Black Arrow

## Vicious Engine
<section class="postSection">
<img src="/public/images/engines/ViciousEngineLogo.jpg" style="width:inherit;" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" />
<div markdown="1">
The Vicious Engine was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and released late in the Xbox lifecycle in early 2005, thus very few 3rd party game developers used this engine for the Xbox but it was nevertheless available to them during the end of the Xbox lifespan.
  
To find out if your games uses this engine, look for games that have `*.rgn` files, RGN stands for Region in this case which is the terminology Vicious Engine uses for Maps/Levels. Although other games that don't use this engine could also use .rgn for a filename such as `Star Wars - Obi Wan` so we will need a better method of detection.

Games:
* Curious George
* Dinotopia: The Sunstone Odyssey [^6]
* Robotech Invasion [^6]
* Spy vs. Spy [^6]

## Gamebryo (formerly NetImmerse)

<img src="/public/images/engines/GameBryoLogo.jpg" style="width:inherit;" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" />
<div markdown="1">
The Gamebryo engine was developed by Gamebase and licensed to 3rd party game developers such as UbiSoft and Atari for use on the Xbox and other gaming platforms [^5].
  
To find out if your games uses this engine, look for .kfm files or .nif files or references to `NiSystem` or `Gamebryo File Format` in the main game executable.

# In-House Game Engines

<div markdown="1">
