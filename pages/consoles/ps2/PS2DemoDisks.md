This page is dedicated to listing PS2 Demo Discs that contain developer debug symbols, either embedded inside the executable or as separate .map or .sym files.

It was much more common for PS2 debug symbols to be leaked on Demo Discs than their retail counterparts during the early days of the PS2 lifespan, later in the lifespan Demos with Debug symbols became rarer and rarer.

# PS2 Demo Discs from Official Playstation 2 Magazine UK
The Official Playstation 2 Magazine in the UK often had a playable PS2 Demo free with every magazine, this was a great way for games to 'try before you buy'.

You can find out more about these Demo Discs over at crimson-ceremony.net: [demo pals - OPS2M Demo UK](https://crimson-ceremony.net/demopals/ops2muk/index.php?img=uk005#SCED-50140).
