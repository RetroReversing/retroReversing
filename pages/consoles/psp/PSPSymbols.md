The Sony Playstation portable used encrypted executables known as `EBOOT.BIN`, these are basically just an encrypted ELF file and it is possible to decrypt them with the correct tools. Some games also ship with unencrypted executables in `BOOT.BIN`

Finding Debug symbols in retail PSP games is very rare as one of the test cases in the Sony TRC (Technical Requirements Checklist) makes sure that all games that get published do not contain debug symbols:

> It is forbidden to include the following types of files in the master in any form, even in archive format:
> - Data and files used only for development and debugging purposes such as program source files, executable files with symbols, map files, and driver modules used in title development
> - Data and files designed only for use on other platforms such as Windows wallpaper and screensavers

# Types of PSP Symbol files

## SYM Symbol Files

.SYM Files are generated by the SN Systems ProDG SDK for PSP for use in debugging, they contain all the symbols (function names etc) and can also contain other chunks such as source filenames and line numbers.

## MAP Symbol Files
Similar to .sym files but are created by the linker to document where each function is located in the final linked executable.

# ViciousEngine
Many games using the ViciousEngine actually came with both the .sym and .map files compressed inside the `DATA.PAK` file.
ViciousEngine was one of the few game engines recommended officially by Sony, and in fact they offered a discount for the engine if it was used to create a PSP Mini [^1].

You can extract the .sym and .map file by opening the `PSP_GAME/USRDIR/DATA.PAK` with 

The `DATA.PAK` file normally contains some files with a name that is a variation of `Game-dvd.map` and `Game-dvd.sym`.

## ViciousEngine Games with Debug Symbols

* Ben 10 - Alien Force (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It) (PSP) (PSN)

# Games with PRX symbols
Some games implement some major parts of the game logic in prx files rather than in the EBOOT executables. The PRX format contains lots of debug information as its a dynamic library which requires the symbols to be exported (the same as a windows dll).
* **Flowars** (KOR) `/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/umodule/flowars.prx`
* **SSX On Tour** (KOR) (PRX files with lots of debug symbols)
* **SOCOM US Navy Seals Portable** (JPN) (/PSP_GAME/USRDIR/TACTICS.PRX)


# Other Retail Games with Debug Symbols
Outside of games that use the Vicious Engine it is very rare to find games that bundled with their debug symbols, but there are a few games:
* **Need for Speed - ProStreet** (Europe) (PSP) (PSN) (big files)
* **Chandragupta Warrior Prince** (EUR) - mentions of C-like exports (infernal engine)

## Games with Lua Scripting
While not quite debug symbols, these games contain unencrypted Lua scripts that can be modified
* Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Europe) (PSN)

## Games with Squirrel Scripting
[Squirrel - The Programming Language](http://squirrel-lang.org/)
* The Mystery Team

## Games with Makefiles
* **Circles, Circles, Circles** (Europe) (minis) (PSN)
* **D-Cube Planet (Europe)** (minis) (PSN)
* Deflector (Europe) (minis) (PSN)
* Route 66 (Europe) (minis) (PSN)

    * the bash script mentions SN Systems the company that created the ProDG SDK
* Ghostbusters The Video Game (EUR)
