# Introduction 

## What is the SN Systems ProDG PSP SDK?
SN Systems were in the business of creating excellent 3rd party development tools and many game development studios relied on them to provide first class tools for console development. The PSP was no different and SN Systems started developing its PSP version of its popular ProDG SDK sometime in 2003 (as far as we know).

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/companies/snsystems/" description="For more information about SN Systems check out this post." %}

Although SN Systems were later bought by Sony in 2005, the 2004 version of the SDKs are a true third party SDk competing with the official Sony software development kit [^4].

The SN Systems ProDG tools were later incorporated into the official Sony PSP SDK, the first version that did this is unknown but it was present in the 6.6.0 release from 2011.

## What was contained in the SDK?
The SDK contained the SN Systems Compilers (SNC C/C++), which unlike their previous SDKs, was a new compiler toolchain not based on GCC. It was optimized specifically for the handheld's CPU architecture, allowing it to generate faster assembly code compared to Sony's standard SDK.

The SDK contained a few main parts:
* **ProDG Tuner** (TunerforPSPv1.6.0.exe) - Game optimization
* **Target Manager** (ProDGforPSPv1.4.1.exe) - Development Kit managment interface
* **Proview** (ProViewforPSPv1.2.1.exe) - Artist preview tool

### ProDG Tuner
The SDK also contained the ProDG Tuner (Tuner-LE) which was used to for game optimization by visualising code and providing information about where the main bottlenecks are [^2].

### Target Manager
Similar to the ProDG SDKs for other consoles this SDK included the **Target Manager** which allowed shared usage of multiple PSP development Kits via the internal network.

### Proview (Proview-LE)
Proview is an optional part of the SDK tailored to artists, this allows them to test how their assets look and run on the PSP hardware without having to create a new build of the game. This can be run through the previously discussed Target Manager meaning any artist PC could connect to it similar to a shared network printer.

## What are the known versions of the SDK?
The first version of the Client License Manager was from **October 2004** (according to the CLM pdf documentation.)

So far we only know of one version number to exist:
* 2.7.1 - used in Need for Speed

But we are not sure if the 2.7.1 is the version number for the whole ProDG SDK or something else, each part e.g ProView, ProDG etc has their own version number with max being 1.6.0 for the Tuner so it is possible that the 2.7.1 is unrelated to ProDG completely.

## Have any versions of the SDK been leaked?
No versions of the original third party 2004 ProDG SDK for the PSP have currently been leaked to the internet, although a photo of it had been shared to Andrew Borman's Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you know, you know <a href="https://t.co/23r0yLiAd1">pic.twitter.com/23r0yLiAd1</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Borman (@Borman18) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borman18/status/1375240658533900289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote> 

![SN Systems C/C++ Compiler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36139fbc-280d-4e8d-9ab3-3e9e22ebe6b9)

However version 6.6.0 of the official SDK does contains the ProDG installers from 2011:
* **ProDGforPSPv1.4.1.exe** - The main SDK including the Target Manager
* **ProViewforPSPv1.2.1.exe** - The Artist development tool
* **TunerforPSPv1.6.0.exe** - The Performance optimizer

---
# Pro DG for PSP 1.4.1 (ProDGforPSPv1.4.1.exe)

The **ProDGforPSPv1.4.1.exe** installer is the last version we are aware of for the PRODG SDK and was released in the official Sony SDK version 6.6.0 in 2011. 

It is a windows setup executable thats installs the main SDK to **C:\Program Files\SN Systems\PSP\** but not the Artist tools (ProView) or the performance optimizer (Tuner).

The 1.4.1 release contained the following development tools:
* Assembler v1.1.1737.0
* SNC PSP C/C++ Compiler v1.2.7503.0
* Linker v2.7.63.0
* PRX tool v1.7.174.0
* Debugger v2.9.9
* Target Manager v1.8.5
* Target Manager SDK
* Libraries
* Utilities
* Visual Studio Integration v1.8.7

## Installation process
checks for any versions of Visual Studio:
![Installer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e31b8473-e087-4f61-87a4-b40afcf38a0d)

It installs into **C:\Program Files\SN Systems\PSP\** :
![Installer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fb4a4a-f79e-4d72-a346-dc794e875f85)

It requires the PSP Hardware SDK (SCE_PSP_HW_ROOT) to be chosen e.g **C:\usr\local\PSP\devkit** this should have alreadsy been installed:
![SCE_PSP_HW_ROOT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17cfbb2c-5e77-4912-aab8-e95b70fe0392)

## Installed Files
After the ProDG installer has run it will have created two new folders in **C:\Program Files\SN Systems\PSP\** :
* Common - Client License Manager
* PSP

### Common Folder
The Common Folder contains two sub folders;
* bin - Contains the two executables **SNLauncher.exe** and **snclm.exe**
* help - Documentation about the Client License Manager in both English and Japanese in PDF and CHM formats

The Client license manager needs to be run as Administrator **SNLauncher.exe** giving the following screen: 
![Error with SNLauncher](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9e3126-9e4f-4fdc-b6f1-c5d0da11ba6e)

When run it gives the following screen:
![SNLauncher.exe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3d9bde-62ce-4b66-a6ce-bef03cf4ab22)

The **snclm.exe** executable opens the following window:
![snclm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c2957f-48f4-4bc3-b2ef-24d42c681cf2)

Its not particularly interesting, but I was surprised that it was still bundled with the latest version of the Official SDK as the license registeration is very SN Systems specific.

## PSP Folder
The PSP Folder contains the main ProDG SDK files, with the compilers in the ./bin folder and the include files in the ./include folder.

This SDK also includes version 4.6.2 of **STL Port**, which is a multiplatform ANSI C++ Standard Library implementation.

### /PSP/lib Folder
<section class="postSection">
  <div class="css-folder css-folder-left wow slideInLeft postImage">/</div>
  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains the static libraries that make up the ProDG SDK pre-compiled for PSP. You will need to include these in your build if you use the SN Systems C/C++ compiler.

  </div>
</section>  

The files in this folder are described in the table below:

File Name | Extension | Description
---|---|---
COPYING | , .NEWLIB |

  <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
 This folder contains all the compiled executables for compiling with the Sn Systems Pro DG SDK.

  </div>
</section>  

The files in this folder are described in the table below:

File Name | Extension | Description
---|---|---
BlankElf | .exe | BlankElf version 1.2 used for submitting bug reports to SN Systems without leaking code
PSPDebugger | .exe | Connects to the PSP development hardware and allows breakpoints and memory editing
demangle | .dll | SN style symbol demangling library, used in snbin's --dem option
make | .exe | GNU Make 3.80 SN Build 1.17

pspcq | .exe | C/C++ Compiler, it runs instead of pspcfe at -O0 and -O1, directly producing assembly files from C/C++ sources
pspdemangle | .dll | GNUv3 style symbol demangling library, used in pspname.exe
pspipa | .exe | Compiler IPA (Interprocedural Analysis) backend, used at optimization levels -O4 and -O5
pspld | .exe | Linker (pspld version 2.7.63.0)

snbin | .exe | The SN binary utilities program snbin.exe is a tool for manipulating ELF/PRX files and library/archive files.

### BlankElf - Used to submitting bug reports to SN System
The purpose of blankelf is to fill the code sections with zero within an ELF file. 
The ELF file will then have only debug and symbol information. It is used when customers want to send SN Systems an ELF file that has something wrong with its debug or symbol data, but they don't want to let a fully working ELF out of the office. 

You can use blankelf to zero all the code, which renders the ELF useless. However, even with no runnable code, the SN Systems support team can load the ELF and see what is wrong with its debug or symbol data.

### Snbin - Binary utilities
The SN binary utilities program **snbin.exe** is a tool for manipulating ELF/PRX files and library/archive files.
Features include: 
* Stripping of sections, symbols and debug data
* Dumping of section headers, symbol tables and program headers
* Dopying sections to a binary file
* Renaming sections
* Demangling SN-styled mangled symbols

### PSP Target Manager (psptm.exe)
<img width="783" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0a1f329-adb8-4a90-bdaa-6e42e16d2287">

The ProDG Target Manager (**psptm.exe**) is used to control access to any development hardware (targets) connected to your host PC, or remotely on your LAN. 

Target Manager must be installed and running in order that other SN Systems applications can communicate with the development hardware.

Target Manager allows you to connect to the target, load and run executable files, send TTY input to the target, and view TTY output from the target.

Target Manager can be used with a range of SCE development hardware.

Target Manager is provided with the following SN Systems products:
* ProDG
* ProView/ProView-LE
* Tuner

# Usage in Games
Although the SDK was (initially) third party it was extremely popular among PSP development studios and many games used the SDK's excellent compilers and debug functionality.

## What games used the ProDg PSP SDK?
As this is a third party optional SDK not all PSP games would have used it as it is not a requirement and some just used the standard official Sony SDK.

However the SDK was still very popular and according to TotalVideoGames.com 20 out of the 24 launch titles for the PSP were created using the ProDG SDK! [^1].

Known games include:
* Need for Speed games
* Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X (just the Narikiri Dungeon X game, Phantasia X uses CodeWarrior)
* Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos
* Weiss Schwarz Portable: Boost Weiss
* Weiss Schwarz Portable: Boost Schwarz
* Fate/Extra
* Kamigami no Asobi
* Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Portable

## How do I find out if a game uses the PRODG SDK?
The SN compiler toolchain has its own way of calling C++ global constructors, while the GCC based official toolchain makes use of the standard **ctor** section for this purpose, pspsnc uses a custom section called **cplinit** (short for C Plus Init) alongside this a function (called **__snmain**) will be injected into the game's regular **main** function in order to call the constructors inside the section, which makes for an easy way to tell pspsnc was used for a game.

Another way would be to run the **strings** command on the main game executable.

Below is an example of strings that hint at the use of the SN Systems SDK:
