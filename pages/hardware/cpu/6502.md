# The 6502 Microprocessor
The 6502 microprocessor was an 8-bit microprocessor that was incredibly popular for 8-bit home computers (e.g Apple II) and consoles (e.g NES) due to its low cost.

Released by **MOS Technology** in 1975, the 6502 was designed by **Chuck Peddle** as an affordable alternative to the more expensive microprocessors of its time (such as the $300 Motorola 6800 that he also worked on) [^1].

## History of the 6502
The [Apple Wiki](https://apple.fandom.com) provides a technical and historical profile of the **MOS Technology 6502**, the 8-bit microprocessor that powered the Apple I, Apple II, and Apple III. The entry details the chip's architecture, including its registers and instruction set, and explains how its low price point enabled the mass market success of Apple's early hardware.

## Usage in 8-bit Consoles and Home computers
The 6502 family shaped early commercial game development through its low cost, simple bus architecture, and efficient instruction set. 

Its derivatives powered many influential consoles and computers, enabling designers to allocate more silicon to graphics and audio subsystems while retaining sufficient compute for real time game logic:
* **Apple II (6502)** - Leveraged the base 6502 in combination with soft switches and an open expansion architecture that fostered rapid growth in commercial and hobbyist game development [^1].
* **Atari 8 bit Family (6502)** - Combined with **ANTIC** and **GTIA** coprocessors, the 6502 enabled hardware assisted scrolling, sprites, and display list interrupts, introducing a more advanced rendering model.
* **Atari 2600 (6507 variant)** - Used a variant of the 6502, the **MOS 6507** with no frame buffer and relies on cycle precise CPU involvement in video generation through the TIA. The programming model is fundamentally "racing the beam".
* **Atari Lynx (65SC02)** - Used custom CMOS chip called "Mikey" (65SC02) which is a 6502 variant running at up to 4 MHz with hardware scaling, sprite engines, and coprocessor assisted rendering processor [^3].
* **BBC Micro (6502)** - Provided high performance for its class with deterministic memory timing and a clean system architecture that supported both educational and commercial game software.
* **Commodore 64 (6510)** - A 6502 derivative with an integrated I/O port for bank switching, allowing flexible memory layouts and tight coordination with the VIC-II and SID chips [^2].
* **Nintendo Entertainment System (Ricoh 2A03/2A07)** - A customized 6502 core without decimal mode, integrating the APU and I/O. Its deterministic CPU-PPU-DMA timing enabled the characteristic NES game pipeline.

### Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
The **Nintendo Entertainment System** (known as the Famicom in Japan) is an 8-bit console that revolutionized home gaming, powered by a 6502-based Ricoh 2A03 CPU. Our page serves as a comprehensive hub for reverse engineering the hardware, detailing the unique architecture of the Picture Processing Unit (PPU), the Audio Processing Unit (APU), and the system's memory map. It also collects essential resources, tutorials, and tools for emulator developers and homebrew enthusiasts.

### Reverse Engineering the MOS 6502 CPU
In this detailed technical presentation from the 27th Chaos Communication Congress, [Michael Steil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWqBmmPQP40) explores the inner workings of the MOS 6502 processor, the chip powering iconic systems like the Apple II, NES, and Commodore 64. 

The talk breaks down the reverse engineering process into three distinct approaches: top-down (analyzing the instruction set and quirks), bottom-up (using acid decapping and high-resolution die shots to vectorize the transistor netlist), and inside-out (simulating the logic to understand undocumented behaviors and illegal opcodes). This work culminated in the **Visual 6502** project, a transistor-perfect simulation of the hardware.

## 6502 in Popular Culture

### The Truth About Bender's Brain: The 6502 Connection
<img width="620" height="465" alt="Bender from Futurama's brain is a 6502" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b56c4d-6db1-4647-872d-e10894abcbf8" />
[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org) investigates the famous *Futurama* easter egg that identifies Bender's CPU as a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. The article features an interview with head writer David X. Cohen, who explains that the choice was a deliberate homage to his own teenage years spent coding 6502 assembly language for the Apple II.
