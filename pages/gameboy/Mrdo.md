The source code for Ocean Software's Mr Do! port to the gameboy has been officially released by two of the original developers.
Description from Paul Hughes [^1]
```
Many moons ago I debugged and finished off Ocean's Mr Do! for the original Gameboy. 

As Joffa, the late, great original author, decided to release the source code, 

I thought I'd also put it up.
```

The header for the source file also mentions Wesley Knackets developed it between the 28th of June and the 5th of September 1990, which is just a little over 2 months!
