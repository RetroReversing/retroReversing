It is very rare that a commercial game releases its source code to the public, it is even rarer for that to be a console game, but there have been a few exciting cases in recent history which we will explore in this post.

To be considered for this list the game must have at least a quarter of the source code used to make the game/prototype released.

This list does not contain fan decompilations of retail games, for those we have a separate page:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/source-code/decompiled-retail-console-games" description="For the list of decompiled games check out this post." %}

# Nintendo Systems
Nintendo systems have by far the largest selection of official source code to choose from, some of it has been leaked and others have been released officially by the developers.

## GameBoy (DMG & GBC)

### Days of Thunder

### Little Mermaid Pinball

## Game Boy Advance
The GBA was the first Nintendo portable to have most of its games written in the C language as compilers had finally become good enough to develop full retail games with.

### Manic Miner

## Nintendo Entertainment System
Games for Nintendo's first console was almost exclusivly written in 6502 assembly language as anything higher level would simply be too slow due to early compilers producing less efficient code than human programmers.

This section has all the consoles Microsoft made which are considered retro enough to include here. We currently do not list anything after the original Xbox but this may change in the future when the 360 can safely be classified as a retro system.

## Original Xbox
The original Xbox was a joy to program for, especially for PC developers who were familiar with the Direct X API. However very few xbox games have ever has their source code leaked.
