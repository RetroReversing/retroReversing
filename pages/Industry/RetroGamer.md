Retro Gamer is a British magazine devoted entirely to classic video games, first launched in January 2004 [^1]. Over the past 20+ years it has grown from a niche quarterly into a monthly archive of gaming history, publishing high-quality retrospectives, developer interviews, and reader-favorite features on titles from the 1970s through early 2000s . 

The magazine’s content and structure have continually evolved – from its early format under Live Publishing (complete with cover CD-ROMs of emulators) to later expansions under Imagine and Future plc [^2].


# Interviews with Game Developers
One of Retro Gamer’s hallmarks is its extensive interviews with the creators of classic video games. Nearly every issue features conversations with veteran developers, offering first-hand insights into the making of beloved games and the industry’s early days. 

These interviews often explore how iconic titles were designed under the technical constraints along with creative tricks used to overcome the hardware limitations.
