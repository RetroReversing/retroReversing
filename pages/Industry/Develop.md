# Develop
**Develop** was a UK magazine dedicated to game developers in the industry similar to the US magazine **Game Developer**, it published 11 issues a year, one a month except December and January where there was one issue for both months. 

After 188 issues it was merged with its sister title **MCV** to become **MCV/Develop** but it kept the MCV issue numbering.

As of 2025 MCV/Develop is still being published and is free online, go and show your support: [MCV/DEVELOP - Video games industry news, events, research and jobs](https://mcvuk.com/)

## Contents
For most of its run the magazine was divided into the following 3 sections:
* **Alpha** - News and views on game development
* **Beta** - Development features, Interviews, essays and more
* **Build** - The latest tools news, tech updates and tutorials

Other subsections included:
* **Develop Jobs** - Your monthly guide to the best career opportunities in games development worldwide
* **Directory** - The world’s premier listing of games development studios, tools, outsourcing specialists, services and courses

## Circulation information
The information we have about the circulation (number of magazines sold) are listed below:
* In 2001 it was 5,000
* In 2004 it was 8,263

Most of the information above came from their **Media packs** that they used to send to advertising agencies. Most adverts published in the magazine were highly targeted for Games industry professionals, such as for game engines, middleware, jobs and more, so it blended in well with the rest of the content.

---
## Publishers
During its run it went through a number of different publishers:
* **Intent Media** - 1996-1998 - Also Published **MCV**, **ToyNews**, **PC Retail** and **Mobile Entertainment** magazines
* **MCV Media** - 1998-2012 - Rebrand of Intent Media [^4], but some titles continued to use the Intent Media brand
* **New Bay Media** - 2012-2017 - Acquired **Intent Media** in 2012 including all their titles [^3]
* **Future Publishing** - 2018-Present - Acquired New Bay Media (This was after Develop merged with MCV)

Note that since all the Publisher changes were acquisitions, the magazine continued to use the previous publisher name on the cover.

## Beta Articles
Beta was the main section that contained interviews with industry professionals about specific topics related to the games industry as a whole.

In 2007 some of the interviews from the magazine were also posted on the website, for those we will provide a link in the table below of all the interviews we know about:

## Game Dev Family Tree
One of the sections I love about the magazine was the interesting "Family Tree" diagrams that focussed on one city every month, here is an example of Liverpool:
![Liverpool Game Dev Family Tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3539dfa9-5480-4774-8a69-192a14834609)

It was either sponsored by Amiqus or just an entire advert by them, but either way it provided very interesting information as the games industry is full of mergers, acquisitions and new studios being formed by former employees of other studios.

## The Develop Industry Excellence Awards
Develop hosted an annual game development awards ceremony which was highly coveted in the industry, especially in europe but was also known worldwide. From 2003 until the present day the awards were judged by a panel of 50+ industry professionals across a large number of categories (18 in 2005) [^1].

It is held in London every year and the first was at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington on August 27th 2003 [^2].

## The Website
From 2001 Develop had a website at the url **http://www.developmag.com** which later changed to **http://www.develop-online.net/** in July 2009.

It was initially (2001-2004) a very basic website with a very brief description of the main articles, circulation information and a **media pack** containing circulation information to attract advertisers.

In July 2005 they redesigned their website to include much more information including news which mostly linked to gamasutra articles before switching briefly to Next generation and then eventually posting news articles of their own. A PDF download of the latest issue was available but only after filling in a form to get it emailed to you.

## Cover Art
The Develop magazine had some great cover art throughout the years, we will list a couple of our favourites below. We don't have all the issues so apologies if your favourite is missing.

Issue 37 advertises "Vivarin" a game development supplement to help with Game Crunches (for PS2, Xbox or Gamecube developers):
![Issue 37](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b26572-9fd3-46e8-80ec-58657ca83283)

Issue 40 shows the dream 'Superstar developer" who makes millions:
