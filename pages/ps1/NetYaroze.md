If you ever bought the UK Official PlayStation Magazine, chances are you knew about Net Yaroze - the Black Console that people used to make their own games for the system!  Some of these appeared on the demo discs, but they're only a small chunk of what people were creating...in this video, we cover the story of Net Yaroze and its users, a whole bunch of games, and the legacy of perhaps the first popular consumer dev kit for a console in the West.  Enjoy!

Special Thanks to XPCoin, who is one of the few people who have documented the process of developing for Net Yaroze on YouTube!  Check him out here:  https://www.youtube.com/user/gwald
