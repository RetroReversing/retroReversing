During the Nintendo 64s lifetime 3D modelling tools evolved at an incredible pace. 3D games were the new trend which pushed developers into creating new 3D games in order to get published.

For Nintendo 64 3D Model development the official standards were NinGen (based on MultiGen) or Alias but it was also common to use SoftImage, Nichimen Graphics or Autodesk's 3DStudio.

# 3D Modelling
3D Modelling software was relatively new when development for Nintendo 64 game started, but during the lifetime many new products flooded the market and by the end artists were spoiled for choice.

## Ningen/Multigen/GameGen

Ningen was a custom version of the realtime 3D modelling software called `MultiGen` created by the company `Multigen Inc`. 

The company Multigen were known for creating very good 3D modelling tools for a variety of purposes, such as flight simulators and games.

They were developed to run on Sri's IRIX Operating system and so would be limited to developers who can afford the cost of the SGI workstations.

The product known as `Ningen` was later renamed to `Gamegen` and supported other consoles such as a Playstation 1 aswell as the N64 [^4].

Notable Games with assets created in Multigen:
* San Francisco Rush (N64, PS1) [^15]

## Alias/Power Animator/Wavefront

Alias Power Animator was an excellent 3D modelling and animation package developed for SGI workstations. It came at a very high price point of £60,000 but came with plugins especially for Nintendo 64 development but they were not officially supported by Nintendo [^2].

The software later changed its name to `Alias | Wavefront` after buying out the rival company called `Wavefront`.

This package eventually got turned in to `Maya` and was bought by Autodesk, it is still used in the games industry today but not as widely as competitors such as 3DS Max [^2].

Power Animator was used to develop games such as DMA Design's `Silicon Valley` for the Nintendo 64 [^14].

## Softimage
At a cost of £20,000 per license Softimage was a rather expensive product for game development studios to purchase. However its advanced features and excellent support for SGI Workstations made it popular with companies like Nintendo [^1].

Softimage was used in classic Nintendo 64 games such as `Super Mario 64`, `Resident Evil 2` and `Wave Race 64` [^7]. As these started development before Softimage was available for PCs then they were using a version of Softimage such as `Softimage Creative Environment 2.6` which would only run on SGI workstations.

The video above was created by `David Gallagher` and uses Softimage 3D V3.5-3.7 so this would have been available during the development of many Nintendo 64 games as version 3.5 was available from May 1996.

## Kinetix/AutoDesk 3D Studio/3DS MAX

3D Studio 4 was released in 1994 and only ran on the 16-bit MS-DOS operating system. It wasn't until 1996 that 3D Studio MAX 1.0 was released with support for Windows NT.

The main advantage of 3D Studio was its cheaper price point (£3,000) than competitors such as Alias, Multigen and Softimage [^2].

The official Nintendo 64 Developer Documentation refers to the 3DS plugins that Nintendo distributes as part of the official SDK. These plugins allowed 3D Studio to output to the Nintendo 64 format known as `NIFF` [^9].

3D Studio Max R2 was used to create all the vehicles and tracks for the N64 game `Top Gear Overdrive` [^13]. 

### GAMUT-64
Intelligent Systems added support for `3D Studio MAX R2` and above to their `IS-VIEWER64` development cartridge. This provided a bunch of plugins for 3D Studio Max to convert to the Nintendo 64 NIFF and AGT file formats along with the ability to preview 3D models directly from 3DS Max on the n64 hardware [^8].


## Nichimen Graphics N-World
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NECblvMZvpQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One of the most unique things about N-World is that it was written in the programming language Lisp, which is still a very rare occurrence to find commercial software written in a form of Lisp.

One of the benefits of N-World was a feature called `Instant Gratification` which showed a 3D model in real time on the Nintendo 64 hardware [^2].

N-World was used for classic Nintendo 64 games such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie [^10].

## Unconfirmed Other 3D Modelling Software
It is possible that `Lightwave 3D` was used for the creation of assets for some Nintendo 64 games as it was available during its lifetime, and Nintendo even sealed a plugin for Lightwave that exported to their `NIFF` format [^9], but no commercial games have been confirmed that used Lightwave.

NIFF Editor was part of the package known as `NIFF Navigator` and the first version was released on the 9th of October 1997 and the last release on May 6th 1999 [^12].
