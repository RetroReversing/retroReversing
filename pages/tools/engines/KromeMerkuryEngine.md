## Introduction
The **Merkury** engine is a proprietary game engine developed by **Krome Studios**, known to run on PS2, PSP, and Wii.

It is best known for the custom versions of **Star Wars: The Force Unleashed** on less powerful consoles, because the LucasArts version for Xboxâ€¯360 and PS3 was too demanding to port directly to PS2, PSP, or Wii.

Because a significant installed base remained for those consoles, LucasArts opted to outsource a custom version to Krome, using their existing engine architecture under the name **Merkury**.
