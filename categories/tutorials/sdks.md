# Introduction to Software Development Kits (SDKs)
Software Development Kits come in all shapes and sizes, some are built by the games console manufacture themselves and others are built by 3rd-party companies.

We have tried to document all the software development kits available for the most popular retro consoles, so hopefully you will find the posts below helpful.

# Nintendo Console Software Development Kits

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES/Famicom)
No information has been officially confirmed about whether an official NES SDK was sent out to developers, it may have just been documentation about the NES hardware given to developers and the companies themselves needed to pick their own tools.

We do know that Official Famicom development of Mario Bros 3 took place on the **HP 64000 mainframe computers** which had an assember simply called **assemble** that when paired with a 6502 add-on board could have been the SDK used. However since most third party developers would not have these mainframe computers there was no point distributing tools for these computers.

Most third parties had their own custom assemblers and linkers at the time and so each company would have its own SDK toolchains.

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES/Super Famicom)
Unlike the original Famicom system, Nintendo provided third party developers with some tools to make Super Famicom development easier. Although not all of these tools have been archived or released on to the internet, however the tools we know about are documented in the post below.

{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/super-famicom-snes-sdk/" description="For more information on the Super Nintendo development kit check out this page." %}

We also know that it was common for third parties to create their own custom SDK, such as **Sculptured Software** who created the SSDS (**Sculptured Software Development System**) which was released to the internet and is also available in the post above.

## Nintendo 64
The Nintendo 64 SDK was leaked some time in the late 2000s and now can be easily accessed online, this gives us the opportunity to dive in and document exactly what was contained in the Software Development Kit:

## Nintendo Gamecube

## Nintendo Wii

# Nintendo Handheld Software Development Kits
From at least the Game Boy Advance Software development kits for Nintendo's handheld systems were often provided by Nintendo themselves via their online dev portal known as **WarioWorld**.

## Nintendo Game Boy (DMG & GBC)
A few files were leaked from Nintendos development FTP server (WarioWorld?) in the early 2000s, this has allowed us to document some of the known tools that were found in the Game Boy Software development kit:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/official-gameboy-software-dev-kit/" description="For more information on the known Game Boy SDK files check out this post." %}

## Nintendo Game Boy Advance (GBA)

# SEGA Software Development Kits

## SEGA Master System
No information is known about an official SDK for the SEGA Master System or Mark-3 consoles, it is likely that SEGA relied on the hardware manufacturers and thrid parties to provide the tooling such as Assemblers and Linkers.

## SEGA Game Gear
Again no information is available about any Official Game Gear Software Development Kit

## SEGA Mega Drive (Genesis)

## SEGA Saturn
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/sega-saturn-sdk/" description="For more information on the files in the Official Sega Saturn SDK check out this post." %}

# Sony Software Development Kits

## Sony Playstation Portable (PSP)
There are two main Software Development Kits for the Sony PSP, which were both merged into one single Development Kit when Sony bought SN Systems.

ProDG was the third party SDK developed by SN Systems and later incorporated into the official PSP SDK.
