# GDC - Game Developer's Conference
<section class="postSection">
    <img data-image-full="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3665255-3b43-4787-819f-92a49fcd1030" class="lazy-load wow slideInLeft postImage" />

GDC stands for the "Game Developers Conference", which is an annual event held for professionals in the video game industry. 

Originally it was called the **Computer Game Developers Conference** but the Computer was dropped to focus on video games as a whole rather than just "Computer Games".

GDC serves as a hub for game developers, publishers, artists, programmers, designers, and other industry experts to come together to discuss, share, and learn about the latest trends, technologies, and practices in game development. 

The event includes a wide range of sessions, panels, workshops, and networking opportunities.

## CGDC 1988
The first Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held in 1988. It was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, and it took place in his living room in San Jose, California. This initial gathering was relatively small (27) and informal compared to the later iterations of GDC, but it marked the beginning of what would become one of the most significant annual events in the video game industry. 

Since that modest start, GDC has grown in size and importance, attracting game developers and industry professionals from around the world.

The best source of information about the first few CGDC events is to watch this excellent documentary by **GamersGlobal** available below:

## CGDC 2 - September 18th/19th 1988
The second Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held later in the same year, on September 18th and 19th 1988. It was sponsored by Computer Gaming World and would be the first GDC with a pre-planned agenda. It had about 150 attendees, a whole five times larger than the previous conference hosted earlier the same year.

You can find the main talks and their authors in the table below:

As far as we know all the content for these presentations have been lost to time, but please let us know if any slides or notes are available somewhere on the internet.

The conference did not become an annual event until a few years later.

### Developing for MS-DOS
From a programming perspective the session **Developing for MS-DOS** would have been one of the highlights of the conference. Evan and Nicky Robinson were both programmers on hit games **Star Control** and **Mail Order Monsters**. So to hear their perspective on developing games for MS-DOS would have been incredible!

In the Journal for Computer Game Development December 1988 issue Eric Goldberg wrote the following about the session:
> Evan and Nicky Robinson’s “Developing for MS-DOS” was praised by many attendees. While no one professed a desire to grapple with an operating system universally regarded as clunky, the Robinsons were given full marks for a concise explanation of how to get through the odious task of supporting all four of the CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules graphics standards. The IBM PC and clone family is clearly where the most money is to be made in games.

### Reception of CGDC 1994
You can read Ross Erickson's review of this experience at CGDC 1994 in his article published in the Game Bytes Magazine online here: [THE 1994 COMPUTER GAMES DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE](http://www.ibiblio.org/GameBytes/issue19/misc/cgdc.html). He mentions his disappointment at some of the talks and where he was pleasantly surprised.

This years show even had IBM trying to get people to write games for **OS/2** with their sponsored "OS/2 as a Viable PC Games Platform" sessions, I wonder how many developers were convinced because it certainly did not become a viable PC Games Platform and was competing with Windows 95 DirectX talks. I would love to see what content was presented at that, fantastic bit of game development history, what APIs were even shown off for OS/2?

![CGDC 1996](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f171d6a3-2725-43c9-9840-8875ede96bda)

This is the last year before it was sold to Miller Freeman for about 3 million dollars, now being run by a company many developers could feel the change in the conference becoming more corporate [^4]. So this will be the last conference with a presentation by Chris Crawford.

Google Books claims to have the proceedings of the 1996 Computer Game Developers Conference in its library but it doesn't seem to be possible to access its contents: [Computer Game Developers' Conference Conference Proceedings: March 30-April ... - Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Computer_Game_Developers_Conference_Conf.html?id=bdgTAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)

## CGDC 1997 - April 25th-29th
![CGDC 1997](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5842bfd7-c05a-47ac-a425-35037ff9de08)

The 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference was hosted in the Santa Clara Conference Center in Washington, D.C. It was much larger in scope than the previous years and in fact took five days instead of the usual two.

The first 2 days introducted two new sub-conferences:
* Managing Game Development Conference (25th/26th)
* Game Marketing and Distribution Conference (25th/26th)

The Classic CGDC Conference would then take the next three days (27th-29th).

The overall attendees was estimated to be over **6,300** by the July 1997 issue of Next Generation Magazine.
![The CGDC hosted an all-day class on Friday April 25 on managing game development. The classic conference classes (April 25 to 29) covered everything from programming and production to business concerns and legal issues pertinent to the industry. Also, several roundtables focused on issues of game design and the future direction of gaming. Keynote speakers at the show included John Romero, Chris Roberts, and Nolan Bushnell.
Intensive two-day tutorials focused on object-oriented game design, creating online games with lavg.
Softimage development tools and techniques, and 3D Studio Max. One-day tutorials covered OpenGL, windows programming, Debabelizer, and modeling.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c471536a-b80f-44de-ad23-e8707a67fef0)

![The CGDC show has been criticized since changing hands a year ago. Formerly put on by Computer Game Developers* Association (CGDA), the CDC was known as a small homegrown operation nurtured by the tight-knit game developer community. The first annual CDC was a group of 20 people (basically the CGDA) gathered in a living room. Although
CGDA has always held and continues to hold a stake in the proceedings, in 1996 Miller Freeman Inc. took over the show. Many bemoaned the inevitable "growth" that MFI meant for the CDC, arguing that heavy traffic would ruin the independent feel that was once so integral to attendees' enjoyment of the show. The 1995 show (pre-MFI) saw 2,200 people, and MFI grew the 1996 show to 4,000.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/110c049a-0b02-48b1-a4dd-8370dcf1826a)


### Two Day Tutorials
This conference introduced what they called the **Two Day Tutorials** which were tutorials on various software that would take up the full first two days of the conference, presumably for those uninterested in the other two sub-conferences going on at the same time.

There were four of them but no other details apart from their name remain online:
* Softimage Game Development Tools and Techniques
* Object Oriented Game Design in Lingo
* 3D Studio Max
* Creating Online Games with Java

### One Day Tutorials
These tutorials only took a day to complete and were all on the 26th of April, they were:
* Modeling, Texturing, and Animating in Alias Poweranimator for Real-Time Applications
* The Producer's Tutorial: Bringing it All Together
* Programming Games Under Windows
* Writing for an Interactive Age
* Using DeBabilizer for Processing Video Game Graphics
* Writing Games with OpenGL

### Classic CGDC Conference
The Classic CGDC Conference had 200+ different sessions split up into the following four types:
* Lectures - Typical Conference presentation format with Powerpoint Slides
* Seminars - More hands on than Lectures
* Roundtables - Panel of experts talking about a specific talking and maybe answering audience questions
* Sponsored Sessions - Presumably lectures that were not voted on but instead paid to present

### Microsoft DirectX Sessions
Microsoft had sessions advertising their DirectX technology (DirectPlay, DirectSound, Direct3D and DirectDraw) and even from their hardware division (Sidewinder Group).

### Apple back in the games industry in 1998?
There was even a session by **Apple** on using Quicktime for Windows Game Development! Would love to get a hold of what was presented at that session.

### Sponsored Sessions
This year had Sponsored sessions showing off how to program for the newly released **Intel740** GPU and a session from **3dfx Interactive** on Programming with Glide for their Voodoo 2 hardware.

### Arcade Game programming with PC Hardware
In the session **Programming for PC-based Coin-Op and Arcade Games** by Mark Atkins, he proposes that arcade machines of the future will be PCs connected to esoteric input devices like motion chairs and thus will allow easy porting between arcade and home computer when using technologies like DirectX.

He was not the only developer to propose a PC-based arcade as there was another session called **The Future of Coin-Op Games** by the Open Arcade Architecture (OAA) forum members who share their insights on what makes a great arcade game, understanding the differences in creating hit arcade games and hit home games, making money in the arcade market, and how to use arcade as a first-run theater for titles headed for the home. 

### Game Development in Java in 1998?!
There is even a session this year on building games in Java, which was not seen as a viable programming language for game development at the time due to it being an interpreted language with limited APIs for hardware acceleration. Garner Halloran talks about developing the game **Tom Clancy's Politika** in Java which was a virtual board game similar to Risk.

### Microsoft DirectX Developer Day (March 8th)
It included a "Microsoft DirectX Developer Day" on the 8th of March held by Microsoft who presented multiple lectures explaining how to use the new functions of the DirectX 8 SDK. The knowledge about DirectX 8 was so cutting-edge that it required a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be signed to even attend [^6]! But you would walk out not just having the knowledge of DirectX 8 but also an early build exclusive to attendees.

It began with a speech by Chris Jones, about the current state and future of Windows games. Next, Brian Moran, program manager of the company's Windows Division, held a session on precautions in the production of Windows 2000 compatible game software.

The lectures prepared at Microsoft DirectX Developer Day are divided into three areas: 
* Graphics (DirectDraw, Direct3D)
* Audio and Streaming (DirectSound, DirectShow)
* Network and input (DirectPlay, DirectInput)

There were 5 lectures for 1 hour in each field, so a total of 15 sessions were held.

From the original website it looks like the sessions were roughly the following:
* **DirectX 8.0 Graphics Architecture** - Faster and easier than ever!
* **Direct3D 8.0 Base Functionality** - Where it all starts
* **Direct3D 8.0 Vertex Processing** - Look what you can do with vertices now!
* **Direct3D 8.0 Pixel Processing** - And you thought the vertex operations were cool...
* **High level technologies** - Making things even easier to use
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio Architecture** - Closer integration of DirectSound and DirectMusic for maximum flexibility
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio FX** - Enrich your game audio environment
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio Scripting** - Enable post-authoring of your game audio environment
* **DirectShow 8.0** - Movies, video editing, and using the new DirectX plug-in architecture
* **DirectPlay 8.0 Architecture** - Designed for massive multiplayer online games
* **DirectPlay Voice** - Take your online game to the next level!
* **DirectInput Mapper** - Easily add device optimized support to your game
* **DirectInput Mapper CPL** - How to use and customize to match your game UI
* **Application Manager** - Turn your game into a drop-n-play experience!

Note that although we don't have much details on the contents of each of the talks, there is a physical Binder available at the Museum of Play: [Microsoft DirectX Developer Day binder, 2000 - The Strong](https://archives.museumofplay.org/repositories/3/archival_objects/34613)

### The Demo Scene, an Introduction
There was a **special session** that didn't appear in the conference proceedings book which was presented by [Vincent Scheib](https://history.siggraph.org/person/vincent-scheib/) and another unknown author simply known as **Foo** (surname or programming joke?). It is unclear if this session actually took place, it was listen on the GDC Website: [Game Developers Conference - Archives - 2001- Special Sessions Proceedings](https://web.archive.org/web/20020804123427/http://gdconf.com/archives/proceedings/2001/general_papers.html) with a Word document that was never backed up the the Wayback Machine. 

This may be the same session also presented by Scheib at SIGGRAPH 2002 called [The Demo Scene](https://history.siggraph.org/learning/the-demo-scene-by-engell-nielsen-haines-lehtinen-scheib-and-taylor/).

If this session did take place, it is a great example of game developers reaching out to the hobbiest Demoscene for very talented graphics programmers.

A session on building big licensed games highlighted the industry's evolution from smaller teams to larger projects with 25 to 75 people and budgets ranging from $3 to $40 million. The need for well-organized processes and formal development procedures was emphasized, posing a non-technical challenge of integrating these without stifling creativity.

GDC 2004 highlights included: 
* Programming Keynote by **John Carmack** on bleeding-edge engine development.
* Visual Arts Keynote by **John Gaeta** called From Visual Anti-Establishment to Ubiquity and Back. 
* Sony showcased the PSP as a powerful, easy-to-develop-for device. 
* Microsoft unveiled XNA, a development framework for future platforms.

Many of these sessions are freely available on the [GDC Vault](https://gdcvault.com/browse/gdc-04/). However, bear in mind that some of the metadata such as presenters are incorrect on their site and we have a cleaned up version in the table below:

### John Carmack Keynote
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MusKnL2GbQE?si=6nXzztPh3XWHkEfk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
In his 2004 Game Developers Conference (GDC) keynote speech, John Carmack discussed the history of video games, the progress that has been made in the industry, and his predictions for the future.

Carmack started by talking about his own experiences, recalling his first computer, a VIC-20 with 4 KB of RAM and a 1 MHz processor. He mentioned that the first commercial program he sold was developed on an Apple IIc with 128 KB of RAM and 8 KB of video memory.

Carmack noted the progress in the video game industry since he started, with a factor of a million difference in power between the VIC-20 and today's computers. He also said that early computer games were very niche, while now we have things that can appeal to a wider audience.

For the future, Carmack said he is confident that there will be more progress and hopes that there will be a place for innovative and exciting new things in the industry.
Carmack concluded his speech by saying that he is very excited about the future of video games. He believes that the industry has the potential to do great things, and he is looking forward to seeing what the future holds.
