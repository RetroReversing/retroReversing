## View Projection Matrix 

### Reversing The ViewProjection Matrix (Game Engine Reversing)
The **zero-irp** blog features a comprehensive series by **z1rp** on the advanced topic of **game engine reverse engineering**, focusing specifically on dissecting the construction of the **View-Projection Matrix**. 

This multi-part write-up systematically covers the foundational math of 3D transformation matrices (View and Projection), techniques for finding and reversing these matrices in a running game, and detailed analysis of **SIMD instructions** for matrix math. The series concludes with applications like **trampoline hooking** to capture entity positions and explaining **World To Screen (W2S)** transformations.
