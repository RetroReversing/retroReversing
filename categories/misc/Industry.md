# Documentaries showing life in the industry


## 1984 - Life in Imagine & Ocean Software (The Battle for Santa’s Software)
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChmQBK_EaUQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
**Commercial Breaks** was a 30 minute documentary series in the UK about businesses and one episode in particular from 1984 is of interest to this site, it was called "The Battle for Santa’s Software". It followed two British software companies, Imagine software and Ocean, only one remained at the end of the show!

On the **Imagine Software** side Mark Butler was 23 when the documentary was filmed and it shows his extravagant lifestyle with his fast cars and sponsored motorbike teams. He had 70 people working for them in May 1984 and John Gibson was the only programmer over 30 (Known as Granddad).

The documentary starts with Imagine Software looking great and antisipating the next big game, but sadly ends with bankruptcy. This documentary is great for showing the uncertainty in the early games industry, one minute you are on top and gone the next.

Fortunately, former programmers at Imagine Software went on to establish **Psygnosis**, known for the Psy-Q development SDKs.

On the other side was **Ocean Software** and David Ward who managed to survive the time it took to film the documentary and showed off some of their upcoming games for the festive period.

You can find more information about this documentary over on **VHiStory**:

## 1993 - A Visit to id Software (November 1993)

# Game Industry Research Materials
When researching a video game, for reverse engineering or otherwise it can be tricky to find all the relevant sources due to most development being done behind closed doors in a time before the internet was the force it is today. So it is important to keep track of the physical media such as magazines, books and conference proceedings as they contain many information that has never been released to the internet.

## Magazines
Before wide spread access to the internet was common, many game developers would buy magazines to keep up with the latest in the industry and development in general, we have a post covering the most relevant magazines:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/magazines" description="For more information on all the Game development magazines check out this post." %}

### Develop - UK Magazine dedicated to the games industry
**Develop** was a magazine published in the UK targetted at games industry professionals, similar to the US magazine Game Developer it provides a unique insight into game engines, SDKs and other middleware which was never published online.

## Bookazines
Due to the sheer number of magazines being published in the late 2000s, Publishers realised they could collate all the material from their monthly magazines into yearly publication.
This resulted in a rather thick magazine with no advertisements about the size of a book but with the print quality of a magazine, hence the industry dubbed them **bookazines**.

We have an entire page dedicated to just Bookazines related to game development and the technical creative industry as a whole here:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/bookazines" description="For more information on all the game development Bookazines check out this post." %}

## Conferences - GDC, E3 and other games industry related conferences
One of the main ways for different game developers to speak to each other was at yearly conferences such as **GDC** or **Siggraph**:

## Books - Game Development, 3D general games industry books
Books were a must have for any game developers getting started in the industry, from teaching the basics of assembler/C to more advanced topics such as 3D rendering:

## Museums - Games Industry related Museums
Museums about video games and game development are rare but they are becoming more popular, some are physical and others might be virtual experiences, but they are all important for preserving the history of video games:

## Commercial Documentaries on game development
So far we have listed documentaries that are freely available on youtube, mostly from TV broadcasts, but for a list of video game industry documentaries that you can buy check out **IMDB**'s list:
[Video game documentaries](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls079153183/)

## Interviews
One of the best sources of information for how retro games were developed are direct interviews with the programmers themselves. This section lists interviews available online, but for even more interviews check out the magazines section above.

### The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers DVDs
DVD produced for the Kickstarter for the book The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers back in 2013:
[The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers DVD 1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmelLhMEpo4&t=29s)
DVD 2:
[The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers DVD 2 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKbHimftRIA)

Of particular note is in the second DVD:
Enix programmer Toru Hidaka learned to program by reverse engineering the machine code of Cosmic Soldier, and went on to program games, create graphics, sound and compression utilities for Enix, write books on using machine code, and assist in teaching a new generation of programmers.

Also shows of a development utility created to help designers create levels for Gandhara on the PC-88 the numbers are where the enemies appear

# Companies
The games industry is made up of many companies, some as small as a single person and others so large they generate billions in revenue annually. 
There are so many that have come and gone over the years that we can’t write about them all. Instead we focus on companies that pushed the boundaries in terms of the underlying technology, companies that most gamers may never have heard of but that made considerable technical achievements. 
Companies that defined iconic game engines such as **Krome's Merkury**, others such as **SN Systems** or **Cross Products** that created the game development tools that were used by most of the industry. 

Others who used their genius a little more on the unauthorized size by creating products that could allow unauthorized code to run on the hardware such as **Datel's Action Replay** line of cheat devices.

## Game Development Tooling Companies
There are a bunch of notable companies related to retro game development, many of which specialized in creating the Software Development Kits for popular consoles such as the **Mega Drive** (Cross Products) or PlayStation 1 (SN Systems).

### Cross Products
Cross Products was a British company specialized in creating development tools for game programming, founded in 1989 by **Ian Oliver** and **Andy Craven**. It was a collaborative venture between two UK game companies, Realtime Games Software and **Vektor Grafix**. Cross Products created cross-platform development tools and kits especially for consoles during the late 80s and early 90s.

### SN Systems
SN Systems is a company that specialised in creating development tools for game developers in the UK, it created development tools for Sega and Nintendo consoles but is most famous for their Sony PlayStation development tools like PSYQ.

## Game Hacking Companies
There are a bunch of notable companies related to game hacking which not only worked on Cheat devices like the **Game genie** or **Action Replay** but also unlicenced products that allowed homebrew games consoles much to the annoyance of the console manufacturer.

### Datel
**Datel** is most famous for their **Action Replay** line of products but also created homebrew enablers for the Gamecube and Nintendo DS along with tons of unlicensed games and applications for a wide range of home consoles and handhelds.

## Recruitment in the games industry

### How did game programmers find work?
Many Game Boy developers worked freelance and were contracted out by companies to work on a title with a harsh deadline of a couple of months or sometimes even just weeks! Others were hired full-time by companies and would work on a constant stream of new games.

**Jas Austin** was one of the developers who started off freelance on the Game Boy version of **R-Type** but did such a good job that he accepted a full time job a **B.I.T.S** [^1].

He heard about the job through his agent which was a common way for game programmers to find work in the late 80s to early 90s. But by the 2000s games had grown so much that they would require whole teams of developers and hiring freelances who worked from home became rarer.
