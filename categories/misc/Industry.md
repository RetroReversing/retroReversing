# Documentaries showing life in the industry


## 1984 - Life in Imagine & Ocean Software (The Battle for Santa’s Software)

**Commercial Breaks** was a 30 minute documentary series in the UK about businesses and one episode in particular from 1984 is of interest to this site, it was called "The Battle for Santa’s Software". It followed two British software companies, Imagine software and Ocean, only one remained at the end of the show!

On the Imagine Software side Mark Butler was 23 when the documentary was filmed and it shows his extravagant lifestyle with his fast cars and sponsored motorbike teams. He had 70 people working for them in May 1984 and John Gibson was the only programmer over 30 (Known as Granddad).

The documentary starts with Imagine Software looking great and antisipating the next big game, but sadly ends with bankruptcy. This documentary is great for showing the uncertainty in the early games industry, one minute you are on top and gone the next.

Fortunately, former programmers at Imagine Software went on to establish **Psygnosis**, known for the Psy-Q development SDKs.

On the other side was **Ocean Software** and David Ward who managed to survive the time it took to film the documentary and showed off some of their upcoming games for the festive period.

You can find more information about this documentary over on **VHiStory**:

They interview people in the programming (David Kivlin), music (Craig Conner), sound effects, QA (Gordon Ross and Fiona Robertson) and there is a brief view of the motion capture (Darren?) departments for a desperate game.

## Commercial Documentaries
So far we have listed documentaries that are freely available on youtube, mostly from TV broadcasts, but for a list of video game industry documentaries that you can buy check out IMDB's list:

# Game Industry Materials
When researching a video game, for reverse engineering or otherwise it can be tricky to find all the relevant sources due to most development being done behind closed doors in a time before the internet was the force it is today. So it is important to keep track of the physical media such as magazines, books and conference proceedings as they contain many information that has never been released to the internet.

## Magazines
Before wide spread access to the internet was common, many game developers would buy magazines to keep up with the latest in the industry and development in general, we have a post covering the most relevant magazines:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/magazines" description="For more information on all the Game development magazines check out this post." %}

## Bookazines
Due to the sheer number of magazines being published in the late 2000s, Publishers realised they could collate all the material from their monthly magazines into yearly publication.
This resulted in a rather thick magazine with no advertisements about the size of a book but with the print quality of a magazine, hence the industry dubbed them **bookazines**.

We have an entire page dedicated to just Bookazines related to game development and the technical creative industry as a whole here:

## Conferences - GDC, E3 and other games industry releated conferences
One of the main ways for different game developers to speak to each other was at yearly conferences such as **GDC** or **Siggraph**:

## Books - Game Development, 3D general games industry books
Books were a must have for any game developers getting started in the industry, from teaching the basics of assembler/C to more advanced topics such as 3D rendering:

## Museums - Games Industry related Museums
Museums about video games and game development are rare but they are becoming more popular, some are physical and others might be virtual experiences, but they are all important for preserving the history of video games:

## Recruitment in the games industry

### How did game programmers find work?
Many Game Boy developers worked freelance and were contracted out by companies to work on a title with a harsh deadline of a couple of months or sometimes even just weeks! Others were hired full-time by companies and would work on a constant stream of new games.

**Jas Austin** was one of the developers who started off freelance on the Game Boy version of **R-Type** but did such a good job that he accepted a full time job a **B.I.T.S** [^1].

He heard about the job through his agent which was a common way for game programmers to find work in the late 80s to early 90s. But by the 2000s games had grown so much that they would require whole teams of developers and hiring freelances who worked from home became rarer.
