# Introduction to Retro Games Industry conferences
When taking a historical look at the Games Industry one of the most important sources of information are the Conferences that were held to share information before the mainstream internet.

This page will talk about the main Game-related conferences that took place over the period of time that we classify as "Retro", they roughly fit into two distinct categories:
* **Development** - Conferences for Sharing Game Development Information (SIGGRAPH, GDC, Develop)

# Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 
CES stands for the "Consumer Electronics Show." It is an annual trade show and convention that serves as a showcase for the latest consumer electronics and technology products. CES is one of the most significant and influential tech events globally, and it's where many companies, including industry giants and startups, unveil and demonstrate their innovative products and technologies.

CES is known for its extensive exhibition of consumer electronics and technology products, ranging from smartphones and televisions to smart home devices, automotive technology, gaming hardware, and more.

CES attracts a large number of journalists, bloggers, and media outlets from around the world, generating extensive press coverage and reviews of the showcased products.

CES has played a crucial role in unveiling groundbreaking technologies and products that have subsequently shaped the consumer electronics and technology industries. It is a significant annual event for both industry professionals and tech enthusiasts interested in the latest advancements in the world of electronics and innovation.

The first Consumer Electronics Show (CES) took place in 1967. CES was initially held in New York City and later moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Although it features gaming products they have always brushed the games industry aside in favour of more mainstream consumer electronics.

# Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)

E3, which stands for the "Electronic Entertainment Expo," is one of the most prominent and anticipated events in the video game industry. It serves as a showcase for the latest video games, gaming hardware, and interactive entertainment. E3 brings together game developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and gamers to unveil and celebrate upcoming titles and innovations in the world of gaming.

## Creation of E3
SEGA was instrumental to setting up E3, in an interview with **Tom Kalinske** (former CEO of SEGA America) he had this to say about the formation of E3:
> In the early Nineties, CES was huge but it treated the gaming industry poorly.
> We were put in the back, past the new gadgets, computers and stereos and TVs.
> One year, we were in a tent and it was raining. Out Genesis machines got wet and I said,
> "That's it, we're not coming Back".
> We set out to form our own show with favoured third-parties. It became E3.

## E3 1995 - The First E3
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMuJWADkMYY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
E3 1995 marked the first E3 event, created as an alternative to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where the gaming industry was often overlooked.

At E3 1995, the gaming industry was undergoing significant changes, with the Super Nintendo still the most popular console in North America but with new hardware on the horizon, such as Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and the yet-to-be-released Ultra 64 (later Nintendo 64). This event was mainly focused on the Sega-Sony rivalry, with Nintendo's console release delayed until the following year.

E3 1995 consisted of exhibits and presentations, but unlike modern E3 events, there were no livestreams, special guest stars, or musical performances. The target audience was gaming industry professionals, retailers, developers, marketing teams, investors, and journalists, rather than gamers. As a result, these early E3 conferences were more subdued and focused on industry announcements rather than generating excitement among gamers.

# QuakeCon
QuakeCon is an annual convention and gaming event that primarily focuses on the Quake series of video games, as well as other titles developed by id Software, the company behind Quake. The event has been held since 1996 and is known for its emphasis on competitive gaming, LAN parties, and the celebration of the gaming community.

QuakeCon typically features a variety of activities, including tournaments, panel discussions, exhibitor booths, and opportunities for fans to meet and interact with game developers. It has become a significant event in the gaming calendar, attracting thousands of attendees from around the world.

While QuakeCon started with a primary focus on the Quake series, it has expanded over the years to include other games, including those from Bethesda Softworks, which acquired id Software. The convention has also been a platform for showcasing new game releases, updates, and announcements, making it an exciting gathering for both fans and industry professionals.

## Quakecon 2004
John Carmack gave the Keynote speech at Quakecon 2004 where he reflects on Doom 3 Engine Decisions, you can watch it on youtube below:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOVUZZr655o?si=_NP-ZaoE14TnSAqI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The key points from Keynote are as are as follows:

1. **Evaluation of Doom 3 Engine Decisions:**
   - He reflects on decisions made for the Doom 3 renderer over four years ago.
   - Acknowledges some flaws, such as seams on character heads due to mirroring repeat in texturing.

2. **Specularity and Lighting Improvements:**
   - Talks about limitations in skin tone realism due to a single level of specularity.
   - Introduces new technology for specular maps, allowing control over the breadth of specular highlights.
   - Addresses issues with specularity on broad surfaces and introduces reflection vector calculation for more accurate highlights.
   - Discusses the use of cubic environment maps and normalization for better quality highlights.

3. **Anti-Aliasing Challenges:**
   - Highlights the aliasing challenges in surfaces with normal maps and specular highlights.
   - Mentions ongoing work to combat aliasing, considering the analysis of surface normals and specularity factors.

4. **Multi-Channel Texture Considerations:**
   - Discusses the complexity introduced when combining multiple maps (normal, diffuse, specular, etc.) and the need for coordinated adjustments.
   - Notes potential challenges in scaling and rotating independent maps.

5. **Quality Improvement through Renormalization:**
   - Describes the benefits of renormalization of normal maps before lighting calculations for improved surface quality.
   - Addresses the issue of denormalization in cases where normal vectors deviate significantly.

6. **General Improvements and Considerations:**
   - Mentions the need for reevaluation and development of a new rendering engine based on current hardware capabilities.
   - Indicates ongoing efforts to enhance the Doom 3 graphics engine, considering issues like aliasing, specularity, and normal map quality.

Overall, he outlines the evolution of the Doom 3 graphics engine, addressing past limitations and describing efforts to improve realism, lighting, and overall graphical quality in the context of current and future hardware capabilities.
