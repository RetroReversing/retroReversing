# Introduction
When taking a historical look at the Games Industry one of the most important sources of information are the Conferences that were held to share information when the industry was fresh.

This page will talk about the main Game-related conferences that took place over the period of time that we classify as "Retro", they roughly fit into two distinct categories:
* **Development** - Conferences for Sharing Game Development Information (SIGGRAPH, GDC)
* **Showcase** - Conferences for Showing off the latest Games and Gaming Hardware (CES, E3)

This table below lists all the conferences that we are aware about taking place up until 2000:

# GDC - Game Developer's Conference
GDC stands for the "Game Developers Conference," which is an annual event held for professionals in the video game industry. GDC serves as a hub for game developers, publishers, artists, programmers, designers, and other industry experts to come together to discuss, share, and learn about the latest trends, technologies, and practices in game development. The event includes a wide range of sessions, panels, workshops, and networking opportunities.

## CGDC 1988
The first Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held in 1988. It was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, and it took place in his living room in San Jose, California. This initial gathering was relatively small (27) and informal compared to the later iterations of GDC, but it marked the beginning of what would become one of the most significant annual events in the video game industry. Since that modest start, GDC has grown in size and importance, attracting game developers and industry professionals from around the world.

## CGDC 2 - September 18th/19th 1988
The second Computer Game Developers Conference (CGDC) was held later in the same year, on September 18th and 19th 1988. It was sponsored by Computer Gaming World and would be the first GDC with a pre-planned agenda. It had about 150 atendees, a whole five times larger than the previous conference hosted earlier the same year.

You can find the main talks and their authors in the table below:

This years show even had IBM trying to get people to write games for **OS/2** with their sponsored "OS/2 as a Viable PC Games Platform" sessions, I wonder how many developers were convinced because it certainly did not become a viable PC Games Platform and was competing with Windows 95 DirectX talks. I would love to see what content was presented at that, fantastic bit of game development history, what APIs were even shown off for OS/2?


## CGDC 1996
This is the last year before it was sold to Miller Freeman for about 3 million dollars, now being run by a company many developers could feel the change in the conference becoming more corporate [^4]. So this will be the last conference with a presentation by Chris Crawford.

Google Books claims to have the proceedings of the 1996 Computer Game Developers Conference in its library but it doesn't seem to be possible to access its contents: [Computer Game Developers' Conference Conference Proceedings: March 30-April ... - Google Books](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Computer_Game_Developers_Conference_Conf.html?id=bdgTAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)


There were at least 234 talks at CGDC 1996 that to  **The KNOW-IT-ALL Audiovisual Library** page on the audio recordings, they are listed in the table below:

## CGDC 1997 - April 25th-29th
The 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference was hosted in the Santa Clara Conference Center in Washington, D.C. It was much larger in scope than the previous years and in fact took five days instead of the usual two.

The first 2 days introducted two new sub-conferences:
* Managing Game Development Conference (25th/26th)
* Game Marketing and Distribution Conference (25th/26th)

The Classic CGDC Conference would then take the next three days (27th-29th).

The overall attendees was estimated to be over **6,300** by the July 2997 issue of Next Generation Magazine.

### Two Day Tutorials
This conference introduced what they called the **Two Day Tutorials** which were tutorials on various software that would take up the full first two days of the conference, presumably for those uninterested in the other two sub-conferences going on at the same time.

There were four of them but no other details apart from their name remain online:
* Softimage Game Development Tools and Techniques
* Object Oriented Game Design in Lingo
* 3D Studio Max
* Creating Online Games with Java

### One Day Tutorials
These tutorials only took a day to complete and were all on the 26th of April, they were:
* Modeling, Texturing, and Animating in Alias Poweranimator for Real-Time Applications
* The Producer's Tutorial: Bringing it All Together
* Programming Games Under Windows
* Writing for an Interactive Age
* Using DeBabilizer for Processing Video Game Graphics
* Writing Games with OpenGL

Sadly the website didn't list who actually presented these tutorials but if you know please submit a Pull Request or leave a comment below.

### Game Marketing and Distribution Conference

The first day talks were:
* Going Global: Worldwide Strategies for International Markets
* Breaking Into the Chinese Market: Market Entry, Publishing and Distribution of CD-Rom Titles in China
* Distribution Standards for the Game Industry 
* Internet Entertainment: The Profits and the Pitfalls
* Packaging
* Licensing
* How To Win At Distribution
* The State of the Post-Christmas Game Market
* Online Marketing Strategies
* Games for Promotional Purposes: The Business of Business Games
* Leveraging 3D in Your Marketing Plan
* Building on Success

The second day talks were:
* Market Research Boot Camp
* How to Create Branded Products That Cover Multiple Media
* Educating the Retailer
* Distribution Options For Today's Market
* Legal Issues In Online Distribution: Warnings About Unresolved Issues
* Strategic Pricing 
* Maximizing Your Online Presence
* Working With Developers
* Breaking into Latin American Markets
* Retailers Talk Back
* Brand Management: CD Rom into Film 
* Changing the Face of Interactive Entertainment
* Shaping the Interactive Software Market for the New Millenium

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Managing Game Development Conference

The first day talks were:
* Team == Software
* Lucid Ignorance
* Bullshit Management Meetings That Don't Suck
* Enrapturing the Customer
* Building That "Shared Vision Thing"

The Day 2 talks were:
* Facing the Black Hats: Strategies for dealing with Management
* Being the Black Hats: Managing People Who Give a Shit
* Where Am I: Finding Yourself in Software
* The Deeper Problem: Breaking the Loop of Failure
* Thinking Fishbowl
* Creativity Shop: A Kick in Your Mental Ass Leading a Quality Jihad

Pretty much nothing is available online about who gave these talks or what they contained.

### Classic CGDC Conference
The Classic CGDC Conference had 200+ different sessions split up into the following four types:
* Lectures - Typical Conference presentation format with Powerpoint Slides
* Seminars - More hands on than Lectures
* Roundtables - Panel of experts talking about a specific talking and maybe answering audience questions
* Sponsored Sessions - Presumably lectures that were not voted on but instead paid to present

All the talks from the two days of the "Classic" Computer Developers Conference are in the table below. If you know of any links to videos, slides, reviews or even notes from any of the sessions please add them to the Notes column in the table.

For me some of the most interesting sessions from this day were the **Sponsored Sessions** presented by Industry Heavyweights that are still household gaming names today and others who have fallen by the wayside (Nichimen Graphics I am looking at you).

### Microsoft DirectX Sessions
Microsoft had sessions advertising their DirectX technology (DirectPlay, DirectSound, Direct3D and DirectDraw) and even from their hardware division (Sidewinder Group).

### Apple back in the games industry in 1998?
There was even a session by **Apple** on using Quicktime for Windows Game Development! Would love to get a hold of what was presented at that session.

## GDC 1998 - May 4th-8th
The 1998 Computer Game Developers Conference was hosted in	Long Beach Convention Center on Long Beach, California. This would be the last one under the CGDC name as it was now rebranded to just GDC [^3].

Playstation Underground had a brief 3 minute look at CGDC 1998, it interviews Jennifer Pahlka who was a female director of the GDC, you can watch on Youtube:

### Sponsored Sessions
This year had Sponsored sessions showing off how to program for the newly released **Intel740** GPU and a session from **3Dfx Interactive** on Programming with Glide for their Voodoo 2 hardware.

### Arcade Game programming with PC Hardware
In the session **Programming for PC-based Coin-Op and Arcade Games** by Mark Atkins, he proposes that arcade machines of the future will be PCs connected to esoteric input devices like motion chairs and thus will allow easy porting between arcade and home computer when using technologies like DirectX.

He was not the only developer to propose a PC-based arcade as there was another session called **The Future of Coin-Op Games** by the Open Arcade Architecture (OAA) forum members who share their insights on what makes a great arcade game, understanding the differences in creating hit arcade games and hit home games, making money in the arcade market, and how to use arcade as a first-run theater for titles headed for the home. 

### Game Development in Java in 1998?!
There is even a session this year on building games in Java, which was not seen as a viable programming language for game development at the time due to it being an interpreted language with limited APIs for hardware acceleration. Garner Halloran talks about developing the game **Tom Clancy's Politika** in Java which was a virtual board game similar to Risk.

### Sega's 1999 GDC Keynote
In this speech, Bernard Stolar, president and COO of Sega of America, addresses how the company is preparing for the new marketplace with its Dreamcast video game system. Dreamcast's unique architecture creates a machine that is up to 15 times more powerful than current consoles and can actually change and grow with the gamer. Stolar discusses the benefits of creating games for a platform that will actually evolve, not just with simple peripheral add-ons, but with significant technologies that keep the machine as fresh, current and competitive as the day it was purchased.

### Microsoft DirectX Developer Day (March 8th)
It included a "Microsoft DirectX Developer Day" on the 8th of March held by Hicrosoft who presented multiple lectures explaining how to use the new functions of the DirectX 8 SDK. The knowledge about DirectX 8 was so cutting-edge that it required a  Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to be signed to even attend [^6]! But you would walk out not just having the knowledge of DirectX8 but also an early build exclusive to atendees.

It began with a speech by Chris Jones, about the current state and future of Windows games. Next, Brian Moran, program manager of the company's Windows Division, held a session on precautions in the production of Windows 2000 compatible game software.

The lectures prepared at Microsoft DirectX Developer Day are divided into three areas: 
* Graphics (DirectDraw, Direct3D)
* Audio and Streaming (DirectSound, DirectShow)
* Network and input (DirectPlay, DirectInput)

There were 5 lectures for 1 hour in each field, so a total of 15 sessions were held.

From the original website it looks like the sessions were roughly the following:
* **DirectX 8.0 Graphics Architecture** - Faster and easier than ever!
* **Direct3D 8.0 Base Functionality** - Where it all starts
* **Direct3D 8.0 Vertex Processing** - Look what you can do with vertices now!
* **Direct3D 8.0 Pixel Processing** - And you thought the vertex operations were cool...
* **High level technologies** - Making things even easier to use
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio Architecture** - Closer integration of DirectSound and DirectMusic for maximum flexibility
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio FX** - Enrich your game audio environment
* **DirectX 8.0 Audio Scripting** - Enable post-authoring of your game audio environment
* **DirectShow 8.0** - Movies, video editing, and using the new DirectX plug-in architecture
* **DirectPlay 8.0 Architecture** - Designed for massive multiplayer online games
* **DirectPlay Voice** - Take your online game to the next level!
* **DirectInput Mapper** - Easily add device optimized support to your game
* **DirectInput Mapper CPL** - How to use and customize to match your game UI
* **Application Manager** - Turn your game into a drop-n-play experience!

Note that although we don't have much details on the contents of each of the talks, there is a physical Binder available at the Museum of Play: [Microsoft DirectX Developer Day binder, 2000 - The Strong](https://archives.museumofplay.org/repositories/3/archival_objects/34613)

### The Demo Scene, an Introduction
There was a **special session** that didn't appear in the conference proceedings book which was presented by  [Vincent Scheib](https://history.siggraph.org/person/vincent-scheib/) and another unknown author simply known as **Foo** (surname or programming joke?). It is unclear if this session actually took place, it was listen on the GDC Website: [Game Developers Conference - Archives - 2001- Special Sessions Proceedings](https://web.archive.org/web/20020804123427/http://gdconf.com/archives/proceedings/2001/general_papers.html) with a Word document that was never backed up the the Wayback Machine. 

This may be the same session also presented by Scheib at SIGGRAPH 2002 called [The Demo Scene](https://history.siggraph.org/learning/the-demo-scene-by-engell-nielsen-haines-lehtinen-scheib-and-taylor/).

If this session did take place, it is a great example of game developers reaching out to the hobbiest Demoscene for very talented graphics programmers.

## GDC 2004 - Evolve
The 2004 Game Developers Conference had the theme "Evolve," emphasizing the industry's shift towards middleware and robust production processes. The dominance of licensed titles and sequels was noted, with Dave Perry discussing these trends in his keynote.

A session on building big licensed games highlighted the industry's evolution from smaller teams to larger projects with 25 to 75 people and budgets ranging from $3 to $40 million. The need for well-organized processes and formal development procedures was emphasized, posing a non-technical challenge of integrating these without stifling creativity.

GDC 2004 highlights included: 
* Programming Keynote by **John Carmack** on bleeding-edge engine development 
* Visual Arts Keynote by **John Gaeta** called From Visual Anti-Establishment to Ubiquity and Back. 
* Sony showcased the PSP as a powerful, easy-to-develop-for device. 
* Microsoft unveiled XNA, a development framework for future platforms.

Many of these sessions are freely available on the [GDC Vault](https://gdcvault.com/browse/gdc-04/) however bare in mind some of the meta data such as presenters are incorrect on their site and we have a cleaned up version in the table below:

# Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 
CES stands for the "Consumer Electronics Show." It is an annual trade show and convention that serves as a showcase for the latest consumer electronics and technology products. CES is one of the most significant and influential tech events globally, and it's where many companies, including industry giants and startups, unveil and demonstrate their innovative products and technologies.

CES is known for its extensive exhibition of consumer electronics and technology products, ranging from smartphones and televisions to smart home devices, automotive technology, gaming hardware, and more.

CES attracts a large number of journalists, bloggers, and media outlets from around the world, generating extensive press coverage and reviews of the showcased products.

CES has played a crucial role in unveiling groundbreaking technologies and products that have subsequently shaped the consumer electronics and technology industries. It is a significant annual event for both industry professionals and tech enthusiasts interested in the latest advancements in the world of electronics and innovation.

The first Consumer Electronics Show (CES) took place in 1967. CES was initially held in New York City and later moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Although it features gaming products they have always brushed the games industry aside in favour of more mainstream consumer electronics.

# Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)

E3, which stands for the "Electronic Entertainment Expo," is one of the most prominent and anticipated events in the video game industry. It serves as a showcase for the latest video games, gaming hardware, and interactive entertainment. E3 brings together game developers, publishers, hardware manufacturers, and gamers to unveil and celebrate upcoming titles and innovations in the world of gaming.

## Creation of E3
SEGA was instrumental to setting up E3, in an interview with **Tom Kalinske** (former CEO of SEGA America) he had this to say about the formation of E3:
> In the early Nineties, CES was huge but it treated the gaming industry poorly.
> We were put in the back, past the new gadgets, computers and stereos and TVs.
> One year, we were in a tent and it was raining. Out Genesis machines got wet and I said,
> "That's it, we're not coming Back".
> We set out to form our own show with favoured third-parties. It became E3.

## E3 1995 - The First E3
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMuJWADkMYY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
E3 1995 marked the first E3 event, created as an alternative to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) where the gaming industry was often overlooked.

At E3 1995, the gaming industry was undergoing significant changes, with the Super Nintendo still the most popular console in North America but with new hardware on the horizon, such as Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and the yet-to-be-released Ultra 64 (later Nintendo 64). This event was mainly focused on the Sega-Sony rivalry, with Nintendo's console release delayed until the following year.

E3 1995 consisted of exhibits and presentations, but unlike modern E3 events, there were no livestreams, special guest stars, or musical performances. The target audience was gaming industry professionals, retailers, developers, marketing teams, investors, and journalists, rather than gamers. As a result, these early E3 conferences were more subdued and focused on industry announcements rather than generating excitement among gamers.

# QuakeCon
QuakeCon is an annual convention and gaming event that primarily focuses on the Quake series of video games, as well as other titles developed by id Software, the company behind Quake. The event has been held since 1996 and is known for its emphasis on competitive gaming, LAN parties, and the celebration of the gaming community.

QuakeCon typically features a variety of activities, including tournaments, panel discussions, exhibitor booths, and opportunities for fans to meet and interact with game developers. It has become a significant event in the gaming calendar, attracting thousands of attendees from around the world.

While QuakeCon started with a primary focus on the Quake series, it has expanded over the years to include other games, including those from Bethesda Softworks, which acquired id Software. The convention has also been a platform for showcasing new game releases, updates, and announcements, making it an exciting gathering for both fans and industry professionals.

## Quakecon 2004
John Carmack gave the Keynote speech at Quakecon 2004 where he reflects on Doom 3 Engine Decisions, you can watch it on youtube below:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOVUZZr655o?si=_NP-ZaoE14TnSAqI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The key points from Keynote are as are as follows:

1. **Evaluation of Doom 3 Engine Decisions:**
   - He reflects on decisions made for the Doom 3 renderer over four years ago.
   - Acknowledges some flaws, such as seams on character heads due to mirroring repeat in texturing.

2. **Specularity and Lighting Improvements:**
   - Talks about limitations in skin tone realism due to a single level of specularity.
   - Introduces new technology for specular maps, allowing control over the breadth of specular highlights.
   - Addresses issues with specularity on broad surfaces and introduces reflection vector calculation for more accurate highlights.
   - Discusses the use of cubic environment maps and normalization for better quality highlights.

3. **Anti-Aliasing Challenges:**
   - Highlights the aliasing challenges in surfaces with normal maps and specular highlights.
   - Mentions ongoing work to combat aliasing, considering the analysis of surface normals and specularity factors.

4. **Multi-Channel Texture Considerations:**
   - Discusses the complexity introduced when combining multiple maps (normal, diffuse, specular, etc.) and the need for coordinated adjustments.
   - Notes potential challenges in scaling and rotating independent maps.

5. **Quality Improvement through Renormalization:**
   - Describes the benefits of renormalization of normal maps before lighting calculations for improved surface quality.
   - Addresses the issue of denormalization in cases where normal vectors deviate significantly.

6. **General Improvements and Considerations:**
   - Mentions the need for reevaluation and development of a new rendering engine based on current hardware capabilities.
   - Indicates ongoing efforts to enhance the Doom 3 graphics engine, considering issues like aliasing, specularity, and normal map quality.

Overall, he outlines the evolution of the Doom 3 graphics engine, addressing past limitations and describing efforts to improve realism, lighting, and overall graphical quality in the context of current and future hardware capabilities.
