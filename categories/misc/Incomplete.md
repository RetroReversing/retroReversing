# Incomplete pages

These are pages with the tag **incomplete**, this normally happens on pages that try to cover a large topic but we don't have the time to complete analysis for the whole topic. 
This commonly happens when covering leaked source code due to the huge number of files that are in these archives.
We start the pages with what we feel are the most interesting aspects and leave it up to the community to help us complete the pages in the future.
