# Hacking History

## 2005 - Samy Worm: The Myspace XSS Exploit
[Motherboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtnuaHl378M) features an interview with **Samy Kamkar** detailing the infamous 2005 "Samy Worm" that took down Myspace. Kamkar explains the technical mechanics of the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allowed the worm to exponentially propagate by automatically adding him as a friend and infecting visiting profiles. The video also covers the aftermath, including the site-wide outage and the legal repercussions that led to a three-year ban from computer use.

# Hacking Random Numbers

## How hackers reverse Math.random()
[Zanzlanz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDsYPXRCXAs) has a video that explores the mechanics and vulnerabilities of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), focusing on Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs) and Xorshift algorithms. It demonstrates practical techniques for reverse engineering these functions to predict future values and recover previous states, illustrated by exploiting Flash-based games like Minesweeper.
