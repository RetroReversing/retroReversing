One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game-specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.

# Games Industry Magazines
Occasionally you can be lucky enough to find a whole magazine specifically dedicated to Game Development but they can be few and far between.

Unfortunately, most are now defunct but one excellent title remains until the time of writing: Wireframe magazine, if you are in a position to support this magazine I would strongly recommend it.

Title | Publisher | Notes
---|---|---
Develop | NewBayMedia | UK Magazine which was published from August 1996 Until November 2017
Game Developer | UBM Tech | US Magazine which was published from March 1994 until July 2013 - Note that the free pdfs online do not have the full content such as adverts inside
GameMaker | Future Publishing | UK magazine dedicated to Game Modding and Development. Only 1 issue was published in October 2003 before it became a supplement for the **PC Format** magazine (which also didn't last long)
Journal of Computer Game Design | Self Published | From June 1987 until 1993 when it rebranded to Interactive Entertainment Design
Wireframe | Raspberry Pi Press | From November 2018 and lasted until January 2023 (70 issues)

## GameMaker Magazine
![GameMaker Magazine](https://github.com/RetroReversing/retroReversing/assets/40120498/14c4a79d-0cf1-4c66-8f9e-82976d5e7751)

**GameMaker** was a very unique magazine published in the UK on October 2003, it was a game development and modding magazine targetted at the general public! 

Sadly the topic was deemed too niche and only one issue was ever published before it became a section of **PC Format** magazine for two issues (159 & 160) and then a stand along supplement distributed along with the magazine for a further 3 issues until it was replaced in issue 165 by a Doom 3 supplement instead.

If anyone has the 4 GameMaker supplement magazines from issue 161-164 then please get in contact we would love to see them!

## Journal of Computer Game Design
![Journal of Computer Game Design](https://github.com/RetroReversing/retroReversing/assets/40120498/83baa498-4507-4ff5-a4b7-ab4d59facbf3)

The "Journal of Computer Game Design" was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, in June 1987 [^2]. The journal's primary focus was on computer and video game design. It was one of the first publications to provide insights and discussions on the art and science of game design. 

It cost $30 a year to subscribe and the journeals were released every other month, it was the first attempt to foster a community around game design [^4];

The journal featured articles, essays, and discussions about various aspects of game design, development, and theory. It covered topics such as game mechanics, narrative design, player engagement, and industry trends. No programming or asset development articles were posted it was purley for game design.

The "Journal of Computer Game Design" ceased publication in the early 1990s. While it had a significant impact during its existence, it was succeeded by other publications and academic efforts dedicated to game design and development.

## Relevant Articles
All the articles are now freely available on Chris Crawford's website in a well categorized manner so there is little benefit to repeating that work here, if you are interested in early articles about game design then [head over there now](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/index.html)!

## GameBytes (1992-1994)
GameBytes was a very unique magazine as it wasn't published in a traditional sense, it was released for free online on **Bulletin Board Systems**, it was also unique in its format as it was an actual interactive MS-DOS Application!

Over its relativly short life span it obtained some very interesting articles related to the Game development industry, including multiple reviewes of the **Computer Game Developers Conference** in 1994.

You can experience the magazines online through an emulator on [DOSGames.com](https://www.dosgames.com/gamebytes.php).

## EDGE Magazine
The magazine **EDGE** published its first issue on August 19th 1993 with a focus on going more in-depth on technical details such as how games are made, technical aspects and development issues [^3]. It targeted multiple console/PC platforms (Mega Drive, SNES, Amiga etc) and  is famous for hiring many of the engineers at **Rare** due to their advertisements (Dr Doak is one example of someone who applied thanks to an EDGE advertisement). 

For their news sections they would "borrow" from Japanese magazines such as "Weekly Famitsu" and US magazines such as "EGM" [^3].

    <img src="/public/images/magazines/PSi2.jpg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:200px" />

Published by **Thin-Ice Media** (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue. 

Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.
   
Whether it was always intended to be just another advertisement route for **Datel** or not, it ended up having a good run of 38 issues or just over 3 years on High Street shelves!

## 3D Design Magazine (USA) (1994?-1999)
**3D Design** was a magazine published in the USA by Miller Freeman, we are unsure when it started (1994?) but it changed its name to just **3D** in the July 1999 issue.

![3D Design Vol 5 Issue 4 - April 1999 ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef02646-f3d2-41a7-a468-6109fb25e091)

They also hosted an event called the **3D Design Conference & Exhibition** in 1997 and 1998 including what they called the **Big Kahuna Awards Ceremony**.

Issue | Title | Author | Description
---|---|---|---
1997-06 | Inside The Sixth Man | Gretchen J. Bay | L.A.-based visual effects house Available Light pushes 3D to the limits as we look behind the scenes at the CG effects created for Disney's recent live-action release, The Sixth Man.
1997-06 | Mastering the 3D Pipeline | Omid Rahmat | The Applications Programming Interface (API) affects everything from 3D performance to the actual look of the final image. If the ultimate ambition of your 3D design is real-time interaction, you better get a grip on the basics of 3D APIs because they may dictate how far your art can go.
1997-06 | Accelerated 3D: Round One | Chris Tome | Do you really have to spend a lot of cash to get a 3D graphics board that is perfect for your needs? Not necessarily. Look here as the testing begins on nine 3D boards from ATI, Matrox, Intergraph, Diamond Multimedia, Dynamic Pictures, Accelgraphics, and Number 9, all of which retail for less than $1,000. 
1997-06 | Plugged In | Dan Ablan | That Special Glow. From glowing-hot logos to the shimmering halos of heavenly creatures, Gaffer, Worley Lab's latest release for LightWave, lets animators pull out all the stops when creating shadows and light effects.
1997-06 | Plug-ins on the Side | Gretchen J. Bay | We've rounded up five exciting new plug-ins for 3D Studio MAX, Softimage, and Photoshop that can add flare and finesse to your next design project.
1997-06 | Lighting 3D Cinematically. | Don Schaab and Robert Nederhorst | Lighting is a critical part of any 3D scene, but the principles of lighting have been around a lot longer than any software package you may have. Take a look at some of the tried-and-true lighting concepts pioneered by the folks in the film industry, and see how things done in the movies apply to the computer screen. 
1997-06 | Try to Maintain | Chris Tome | Managing all the resources for your creative endeavors can be a daunting task at best, particularly when they're stored in that silicon-based repository on your desk. Here are some helpful (and, of course, free) solutions to help you organize the plethora of files, data types, and projects cluttering up your hard drive.

## Computer Graphics World (USA)
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/magazines/Computer Graphics World.jpg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:300px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
Computer Graphics World (CGW) is one of the longest running magazines dedicated to computer graphics, published initially in the late 70s right up to the present day (2022+).

One of the good things about **CGW** is that they have articles from each issue available on their web page, going all the way back to 1999. 
   
   However one of the bad things is that they seem to **actively take down** PDFs of pre-1999 issues from sites such as Archive.org. This really is a shame as they are one of the best resources to see the state of the art in 3D graphics at a particular point in time.

Since this website is dedicated to real-time applications of computer graphics the most useful years are from the 90s onwards when colourful 2D and 3D graphics become possible on consumer hardware.
 </div>
</section> 


The magazine is formed of 80+ pages of content, some of which are adverts (interesting CG tool adverts however!) and the following main content sections:
* **Editor's Note** - Also available fully on their Website
* **Letters** - Published user letters sent to the magazine (Only in physical Magazine)
* **Spotlight** - News and Products (Also on Website)
* **Tech Watch** - Interesting articles (Only in physical Magazine)
* **Portfolio** - Presumably Not got copyright permission from individual authors for publishing on their website
* **User Focus**
* **Products** - Also available on their Website

### Free Book Extracts
The accompanying CD for Computer Arts often had extracts from popular industy books in PDF format, this was a great way to both advertise the book in question and supply useful content for artists. Much of these are extracts from books that game artists would almost certainly have in their collection.

### Free Resources
Often the CDs would contain free resources from around the Web, such as a few sample hours of Video training courses or templates/images. One awesome thing they started doing was including full PDFs for issues from 2 years prior but sadly this didn't last very long.

### Free Full products
Occasionally as an incentive to buy the magazine there would be a few paid products that are offered "free" as long as you have bought the magazine. Not all issues included free full products but the ones that did were generally worth picking up, but of course it was always an older version of the products as an incentive to upgrade to the latest versions.

## Web Designer Magazine (UK)
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/magazines/Web Designer.jpg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:200px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
Web Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called **Practical Internet** and was known by the lengthy title **Practical Internet Web Designer** from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.

It was initially published by **Highbury House** until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].

### Total-Web-Design
Strangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title **Practical Web Projects**. This changed in mid-late 2004 when they bought the domain **www.Total-Web-Design.com** to represent both magazines.

Web Designer issue number 97 (from August 2004) had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website which you can view here: 
[Total Web Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20040730202310/http://www.total-web-design.com/) 

### Editors
It was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by **Mark Hattersley** in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have a named editor and was simply signed off by **The Web Designer Team**.

### Issues
Each issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.

The issues we know about are listed in the table below:

Number | Date | Title
