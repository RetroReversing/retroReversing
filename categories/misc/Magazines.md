One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game-specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information that is not currently available on the internet. This post provides details on some of the best magazine sources to help with retro game development research.

# Games Industry Magazines
Occasionally you can be lucky enough to find a whole magazine specifically dedicated to Game Development but they can be few and far between.

Unfortunately, most are now defunct but one excellent title remains until the time of writing: Wireframe magazine, if you are in a position to support this magazine I would strongly recommend it.

Title | Publisher | Notes
---|---|---
Develop | Intent Media / New Bay Media | UK Magazine which was published from August 1996 Until November 2017
MCV | Intent Media / New Bay Media / Future | UK Magazine which was published weekly and is still going today
Game Developer | UBM Tech | US Magazine which was published from March 1994 until July 2013 - Note that the free pdfs online do not have the full content such as adverts inside
GameMaker | Future Publishing | UK magazine dedicated to Game Modding and Development. Only 1 issue was published in October 2003 before it became a supplement for the **PC Format** magazine (which also didn't last long)
Journal of Computer Game Design | Self Published | From June 1987 until 1993 when it rebranded to Interactive Entertainment Design
Wireframe | Raspberry Pi Press | From November 2018 and lasted until January 2023 (70 issues)

# Develop
**Develop** was a UK magazine dedicated to game developers in the industry similar to the US magazine **Game Developer**, it published 11 issues a year, one a month except December and January where there was one issue for both months. After 188 issues it was merged with its sister title **MCV** to become **MCV/Develop** but it kept the MCV issue numbering.

There is a wealth of relevant articles and information in this journal so we have split this section into its own post:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/develop-magazine" description="For more information on Develop Magazine check out this post." %}

The post contains everything we know about the interviews and articles published every month along with additional information that may be relevant to game development history.

## GameMaker Magazine (2003) - Magazine in the UK dedicated to Game Modding
![GameMaker Magazine](https://github.com/RetroReversing/retroReversing/assets/40120498/14c4a79d-0cf1-4c66-8f9e-82976d5e7751)

**GameMaker** was a very unique magazine published in the UK on October 2003, it was a game development and modding magazine targetted at the general public!

Sadly the topic was deemed too niche and only one issue was ever published before it became a section of **PC Format** magazine for two issues (159 & 160) and then a stand along supplement distributed along with the magazine for a further 3 issues until it was replaced in issue 165 by a Doom 3 supplement instead.

We have a separate page with an index of all the articles and other information about the magazine here:

## Journal of Computer Game Design
![Journal of Computer Game Design](https://github.com/RetroReversing/retroReversing/assets/40120498/83baa498-4507-4ff5-a4b7-ab4d59facbf3)

The "Journal of Computer Game Design" was founded by Chris Crawford, a well-known game designer and developer, in June 1987 [^2]. The journal's primary focus was on computer and video game design. It was one of the first publications to provide insights and discussions on the art and science of game design.

It cost $30 a year to subscribe and the journeals were released every other month, it was the first attempt to foster a community around game design [^4];

The journal featured articles, essays, and discussions about various aspects of game design, development, and theory. It covered topics such as game mechanics, narrative design, player engagement, and industry trends. No programming or asset development articles were posted it was purley for game design.

The "Journal of Computer Game Design" ceased publication in the early 1990s. While it had a significant impact during its existence, it was succeeded by other publications and academic efforts dedicated to game design and development.

## Relevant Articles
All the articles are now freely available on Chris Crawford's website in a well categorized manner so there is little benefit to repeating that work here, if you are interested in early articles about game design then [head over there now](https://www.erasmatazz.com/library/the-journal-of-computer/index.html)!

## Wireframe Magazine
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/magazines/Wireframe.jpeg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:200px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
   Wireframe is an excellent magazine that blends developer interviews with practical tutorials such as how to implement various game mechanics in programming languages such as python or even **C programming** for the original Game Boy!

   They even release all the issues they make free on their website in pdf form for everyone (not just subscribers).

Sadly **Wireframe** magazine is no longer producing new magazines after issue 70.

## EGM - Electronic Gaming Monthly
Electronic Gaming Monthly or EGM was a monthly magazine published in the USA by Sendai Punlishing. It often featured interviews with game developers and "Behind the scenes" articles so it is a good source for information on retro game development.

### Pixels to Pages - The Story of Electronic Gaming Monthly
[Game Sack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E010OPY1Tzw) has an excellent documentary about the rise and fall of *Electronic Gaming Monthly* (EGM). It details the magazine's aggressive editorial strategies, such as the "Review Crew" and "Sushi X," and covers the technical challenges of early game journalism, including the use of custom photography rigs like the "cone of silence" to capture CRT screenshots before digital press kits existed.

## GameBytes (1992-1994)
GameBytes was a very unique magazine as it wasn't published in a traditional sense, it was released for free online on **Bulletin Board Systems**, it was also unique in its format as it was an actual interactive MS-DOS Application!

Over its relatively short life span it obtained some very interesting articles related to the Game development industry, including multiple reviewes of the **Computer Game Developers Conference** in 1994.

You can experience the magazines online through an emulator on [DOSGames.com](https://www.dosgames.com/gamebytes.php).

---
## EDGE Magazine
The magazine **EDGE** published its first issue on August 19th 1993 with a focus on going more in-depth on technical details such as how games are made, technical aspects and development issues [^3]. It targeted multiple console/PC platforms (Mega Drive, SNES, Amiga etc) and  is famous for hiring many of the engineers at **Rare** due to their advertisements (Dr Doak is one example of someone who applied thanks to an EDGE advertisement).

For their news sections they would "borrow" from Japanese magazines such as "Weekly Famitsu" and US magazines such as "EGM" [^3].

## PSi2 Magazine
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/magazines/PSi2.jpg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:200px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
Published by **Thin-Ice Media** (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue.

Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.

Whether it was always intended to be just another advertisement route for **Datel** or not, it ended up having a good run of 38 issues or just over 3 years on High Street shelves!
 </div>
</section>

### Relevant Articles in PSi2
As Psi2 was an unofficial magazine published by Datel it was a good magazine for news about development topics and homebrew along with general game reviews and news. Here is a table of the most relevant articles for the topic of the site (game development and homebrew)

Issue | Name | Description
---|---|---
18 | Linux PS2 | PSi2 interviews developers such as Charles Cecil to find out if the PS2 Linux kit can revive the "bedroom coder". They are pretty harsh on the kit and outright say its only beneficial for people learning to program and that its better to learn on Windows with Visual Studio and DirectX

20 | Indie day | Interview with Pivotal games on their game Desert Storm
21 | A Week in the life of **Kuju** |
21 | Indie day | Interview with Argonaut games


### PSi2 Magazine CDs

## Retro Gamer Magazine
<img width="719" height="913" alt="Retro Gamer Magazine cover from issue 20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d459864e-b961-47f7-8494-d21b0d19a190" />

Retro Gamer is widely considered one of the **single best sources** for interviews with classic game developers.

So if you are looking for primary source information on how classic games were made, it is arguably the industry standard for print media.

We have a separate page with an index of all the interviews, articles and other information about the magazine here:

# Creative Magazines
Creative Magazines related to topics such as art/3d graphics and even web development are just as valuable a source as gaming magazines for the time as they would often talk about industry events and software that were often used by game developers.

## 3D Design Magazine (USA) (1995-2000) (ISSN 1083-5288)
![3D Design Vol 5 Issue 4 - April 1999 ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef02646-f3d2-41a7-a468-6109fb25e091)
3D Design was a US magazine devoted to 3D graphics and design, published by **Miller Freeman** in San Francisco. It launched around 1995, with Allison Arden credited as its National Sales Manager who helped start the magazine and its website in 1995​ [^6].

It was typically issued monthly for example, Volume 2, No. 9 corresponds to September 1996​ but it is unclear when the first issue was published.

In mid-1999, Miller Freeman announced that 3D Design would be rebranded as simply “3D” – the change took effect with the July 1999 issue​.

After a brief run under the name 3D, the publication was eventually closed by **CMP Media** (which by then owned Miller Freeman’s titles) around late 1999 or 2000​ [^7].

### Editorial Team
The magazine’s editorial team included industry veterans. Ted Greenwald served as an early Editor-in-Chief, and Kelly Dove was Senior Editor from 1995 to 1998 (later becoming Editor-in-Chief)​ [^8].

Under their direction, 3D Design focused on the rapidly evolving field of 3D graphics. Technical editor Bill McCloskey, for example, wrote a monthly column on emerging web-3D technologies – he was among the first to cover VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) for the Web​ [^9].

Other columnists and contributors (like Barry Fox, who also served as a technical editor) kept readers informed on cutting-edge tools such as VRML, 3D web animation, and hardware acceleration.

### 3D Design Conference & Exhibition
![3DShow 1997](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb5b7b33-88ab-42cb-a6e1-3962986fc74f)

They also hosted an event called the **3D Design Conference & Exhibition** in 1996 to at least 1998 including what they called the **Big Kahuna Awards Ceremony**.
In 1998 it took place on the 19th-22nd of May at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and is credited as the third event which presumably means it started in 1996 [^8].

### 3D Design Magazine Article Index (1996–1999)

Computer Graphics World (CGW) is one of the longest running magazines dedicated to computer graphics, published initially in the late 70s right up to the present day (2022+).

One of the good things about **CGW** is that they have articles from each issue available on their web page, going all the way back to 1999.

   However one of the bad things is that they seem to **actively take down** PDFs of pre-1999 issues from sites such as Archive.org. This really is a shame as they are one of the best resources to see the state of the art in 3D graphics at a particular point in time.

Since this website is dedicated to real-time applications of computer graphics the most useful years are from the 90s onwards when colourful 2D and 3D graphics become possible on consumer hardware.

The magazine is formed of 80+ pages of content, some of which are adverts (interesting CG tool adverts however!) and the following main content sections:
* **Editor's Note** - Also available fully on their Website
* **Letters** - Published user letters sent to the magazine (Only in physical Magazine)
* **Spotlight** - News and Products (Also on Website)
* **Tech Watch** - Interesting articles (Only in physical Magazine)
* **Portfolio** - Presumably Not got copyright permission from individual authors for publishing on their website
* **User Focus**
* **Products** - Also available on their Website

### Free Book Extracts
The accompanying CD for Computer Arts often had extracts from popular industry books in PDF format, this was a great way to both advertise the book in question and supply useful content for artists. Much of these are extracts from books that game artists would almost certainly have in their collection.

Issue | Book Name | Notes

### Free Resources
Often the CDs would contain free resources from around the Web, such as a few sample hours of Video training courses or templates/images. One awesome thing they started doing was including full PDFs for issues from 2 years prior but sadly this didn't last very long.

### Free Full products
Occasionally as an incentive to buy the magazine there would be a few paid products that are offered "free" as long as you have bought the magazine. Not all issues included free full products but the ones that did were generally worth picking up, but of course it was always an older version of the products as an incentive to upgrade to the latest versions.

## Web Designer Magazine (UK)
<section class="postSection">
    <img src="/public/images/magazines/Web Designer.jpg" class="wow slideInLeft postImage" style="width:200px" />

 <div markdown="1" class="rr-post-markdown">
Web Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called **Practical Internet** and was known by the lengthy title **Practical Internet Web Designer** from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.

It was initially published by **Highbury House** until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].
 </div>
</section>


### Total-Web-Design
Strangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title **Practical Web Projects**. This changed in mid-late 2004 when they bought the domain **www.Total-Web-Design.com** to represent both magazines.

Web Designer issue number 97 (from August 2004) had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website which you can view here:
[Total Web Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20040730202310/http://www.total-web-design.com/)

### Editors
It was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by **Mark Hattersley** in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have a named editor and was simply signed off by **The Web Designer Team**.

### Issues
Each issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.

The issues we know about are listed in the table below:

Number | Date | Title

# Translating Foreign magazines
In the age of AI it should be easier than ever to research using non-english magazines, providing rare interviews with early game developers which never made it to english speaking countries.

If you just want to be able to read the content in Text form, ChatGPT 4o (other providers are available) is fairly accurate, just take a screenshot of a page and ask it to translate it to english and you get the basic text content in Markdown format.

However while translating the content of an image of a single page is very easy and accurate with ChatGPT, if you want to be able to read using the original magazine layout but with english text it is very hard to find a tool good enough to do the job. 

This section of the page will review the tools I have tried so far to translate Japanese magazine pages to english while keeping the format of the original image. 

Here is the page that I have used for all of the tests, it is a fairly simple layout and its from the August 1989 issue of Famitsu (issue 80/81) which is an interview with Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris:

# Tetris Lawsuit, Soviet Game Affairs...

# Direct Interview with the Creator of "TETRIS"!!

From fanbooks to international bestsellers—TETRIS is a global phenomenon!
We met up with the creator, Alexey Pajitnov, in Tokyo for this exclusive interview! A genius from the Soviet Union has gifted the world one of the greatest puzzle games ever made.

Meeting Alexey in person, we asked about the Tetris copyright battle, the Soviet game industry, and more.

## Interviewer:

Let’s get straight to the point—who actually owns the rights to Tetris?

## Alexey:

Originally, the rights to Tetris were owned entirely by the Soviet government. Everything I developed was government property, as I was working at a computer research institute at the time. So the rights belonged to the USSR, not to me personally.

## Interviewer:

So when did you first hear that the game had become a global hit?

## Alexey:

In February, I came to the U.S. for the first time and saw the Famicom version. I was shocked! There were so many versions—arcade, home console, PC... I had no idea.

## Interviewer:

What do you think of the home console and arcade versions of Tetris?

## Alexey:

Honestly, I’m thrilled. I created Tetris as a simple computer puzzle, and to see it now in so many forms is overwhelming. As a game designer, it’s a dream come true.

## Interviewer:

What do you think of Japanese developers' interpretations of Tetris?

## Alexey:

Japanese versions are amazing. They’ve taken my simple idea and turned it into something truly spectacular. The arcade version especially is so polished. The sprite movement is clean and fast—it’s very impressive.

## Interviewer:

What was it like working as a game designer in the Soviet Union?

## Alexey:

In the USSR, there wasn’t really a profession like "game designer." I was working with computer logic and AI studies. Game design was just something I did on the side. The concept of making games professionally didn’t exist in the Soviet Union.

## Interviewer:

Do you have any plans for future games?

## Alexey:

Yes, I'm involved in a few other projects besides Tetris. But they’re not quite ready yet. I hope one day people around the world will play those too.

## Slider.ai - Missing text
Slider came up at the top of a google search and offered to "translate images and photos online into 50+ languages with precision and ease.". It certainly does it with ease but the results were far from precise:

## Mangaaday.ai - Messy text
Magazines are rather obscure, not many people are looking to translate them, manga on the other hand have a huge community of people who want to translate from japanese to english so I was excited to try Mangaaday, the results were not the best of quality:

## kling.ai
Kling.ai is not a translator but it does offer image-to-image transformation so I thought I would try it with the prompt "Keep the image exactly the same but translate the text to English". Sadly although the result is cute it is completely unusable.

## Transmonkey - best so far
Another online service that advertises its ability to translate Manga is Transmonkey, it provided the best result so far but its not quite perfect, it has a very manga-like font (unsurprisingly) which takes away points from the quality of the output:
