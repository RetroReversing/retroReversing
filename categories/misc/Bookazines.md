What do you call a product that collects articles from monthly magazines into a single yearly publication? 
The publishers came up with the term "Bookazine" to cover this concept of a very large magazine related to a specific topic.

Many of these were published with topics related to the Games Industry such as 3D Modelling, Animation, Photoshop, Programming or even just Games themselves.

## Retro Micro Games Action
The UK Magazine **GamesTM** had a section dedicated to retro games every month, while it was only a small part of the magazine it had a wealth of interesting information, especially interesting for the topic of this site is the interviews with developers. While its sister magazine Retro Gamer focussed on much earlier retro gaming, the Retro section of GamesTM would go all the way up to PS2 and even PS3!

There were 10 volumes published from 2011 until 2021.

### Behind The Scenes

Game | Platform | Issue # | Notes
---|---|---|---
Robotron: 2084 | Arcade | 2 | Interview with Eugene Jarvis
Shadow of the Beast | Amiga | 2 | 
Xybots | Arcade | 2 | 
MDK | DOS, Windows and PS1 | 9 | 
Icewind Dale | | 9 | 
System Shock 2 | | 9 | 
Duke Nukem 64 | | 9 | 
Star Trek Voyager Elite Force | | 9 | 
Ghostbusters 2 | | 9 | 

### Interviews

Name | Company | Issue | Notes
---|---|---|---
Steve Turner | Graftgold co-founder | 1 | Apparently SEGA systems used the same assemblers as the Amiga?! Maybe custom devkit?
Raff Cecco | | 2 | Spectrum games such as Cybernoid, Stormlord
Geoff Crammond | Firebird, Microprose | 2 | BBC Micro titles such as Aviator, C64, AMIGA, ATARI ST and PC
David Braben | Frontier Developments | 2 | 
Ben Daglish | W.E.M.U.S.I.C. | 2 | Musician for games such as The Last Ninja
The Pickford Brothers | Zippo, Rare Manchester, Software Creations | 2 | Worked on Wetrix for N64, Solstice 2 for NES and many many more
David Anderson | Platinum Productions | 2 | Worked on tons of Spectrum conversions!
Tom Kalinske | CEO SEGA of America | 9 | 
Jas Austin | | 9 | 
Ninh Le | | 9 | 
Dave Grossman | | 9 | 
Stuart Copeland | | 9 | 

#### Tom Kalinske Interview
One of the most interesting interviews is with former SEGA of America CEO **Tom Kalinske** who was in charge when EA reverse-engineered the Sega Mega Drive. He was furious and famously said: 
> "Trip [Hawkins], didn't your mother ever teach you the difference between right and wrong?"

This may have got the meeting off to a rough start but in the end SEGA got **John Madden football** and EA got favoured licensing rights.

#### Pickford Brothers Interview
The interview with the Pickford Brothers was also fascinating and mentioned that they were one of the first studios to get NES development kits outside of Japan and one of the first Game Boy developers outside of Japan. I wonder which development kits they were given for NES and Game Boy... it would have been great to ask them more details about the development kits.

They also managed to play around with one of the first SNES development kits in Europe when they worked at Software Creations. It would have been great to ask them what they remember about these development kits!
