The games industry has had its fair share of cyberattacks in the past decade and one of the main targets for hackers has always been source code. This post will cover all the major leaks that we are aware of for companies related to the games industry. Specifically focussing on programming related source code rather than assets or design documents, but many contain both types of content.

This post covers leaks related to entire companies, if you are looking for leaks for a specific game then check out our page on retail source code leaks:

# Rockstar

Although it didn't contain any programming files, the studio "accidentally" released a folder of internal development tools and game scripts in the retail release of GTA Trilogy for the Nintendo Switch.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Switch version is the Holy Grail for people, who likes behind the scenes. They leaked almost everything for the original trilogy. It includes:<br>Script sources...<br>Text sources...<br>Internal tools...<br>Some other weird files... <a href="https://t.co/FjvONzbeNh">pic.twitter.com/FjvONzbeNh</a></p>&mdash; Vadim M.
