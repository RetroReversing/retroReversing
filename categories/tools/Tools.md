# Explore the Tools of the Trade

Back in the day, game development was both an art and a science, involving a unique set of tools and technologies. On this site, you'll find comprehensive links and guides to the essential tools used during the golden era of video game creation.

# Programming

## Programming Languages
Discover the programming languages that powered the classics. From the assembly languages that squeezed every ounce of performance from early hardware to the C and C++ languages that enabled more complex game designs, we cover the essentials that brought pixels to life. Dive into the specifics of languages such as:

- **Assembly**: The low-level language used for its unparalleled control over hardware.
- **C**: The versatile language that struck a balance between performance and portability.
- **C++**: The language that introduced object-oriented programming to game development.

## Assemblers & Compilers
Learn about the assemblers and compilers that transformed code into playable games. 

These powerful tools were pivotal in optimizing and translating the developers' visions into the games we remember. 

Understand the role of early compilers and their impact on game performance and development workflows. Key tools include:

- **Assemblers**: Programs like MASM and TASM that converted assembly code into machine code.
- **Compilers**: Tools like GCC and Watcom C that compiled higher-level code into efficient machine code.

## Game Development IDEs
Explore the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that were instrumental in retro game development. 

These IDEs provided comprehensive toolsets for coding, debugging, and testing, streamlining the development process for many classic games. Key IDEs from this era include:

- **Microsoft Visual Studio**: A powerful and versatile IDE that supported multiple programming languages, making it a favorite among game developers for its robust debugging tools and integrated development features.
- **Borland C++**: Known for its speed and efficiency, Borland C++ was a popular choice for many game developers due to its advanced compiler technology and comprehensive library support.
- **CodeWarrior**: Initially developed for Macintosh, CodeWarrior later expanded to support multiple platforms, offering a flexible environment for cross-platform development which was essential for many game studios. Had special versions for PS2 and Gamecube support [^2].
- **Turbo C++**: An early IDE by Borland, Turbo C++ was known for its simplicity and speed, providing a streamlined environment for writing and testing code quickly.

These IDEs were pivotal in creating the games that defined a generation, providing the necessary tools and environments to bring imaginative worlds to life.

## Software Development Kits
Every platform had its own official Software Development Kit (SDK), so whether you were developing for the Playstation or the PC you would be interacting with different APIs. In addition there were third parties that created their own multi-platform SDKs which could be used on multiple games consoles or Operating Systems.

We have a post specifically about all the different SDKs for each platform.

## 2D Images, Sprites and Textures
Known software used in the creation of 2D Image asserts for retro video games include:
* **Deluxe Paint** (aka DPaint) - Created by Electronic Arts
* **DeBabilizer** - Shown off during 1997 Computer Game Developers Conference (Used for palettizing sprites for StarCraft [^1])

### 8-bit EGA Pixel art at LucasArts
**Mark Ferrari** has an excellent GDC talk, in which he discussed some of the techniques for drawing 8-bit game graphics, including color cycling and palette shifting in Deluxe Paint:

## Music Creation
Music has always been a cornerstone of the gaming experience. Uncover the music creation tools and techniques that produced the memorable soundtracks of retro games. Learn about the hardware limitations and ingenious methods composers used to create captivating game music. Important aspects include:

- **Sound Chips**: Hardware like the SID chip in the Commodore 64 and the Yamaha YM2612 in the Sega Genesis that defined the sound of many classic games.
- **Tracker Software**: Programs like FastTracker and ProTracker that allowed composers to create music with limited hardware capabilities.
- **MIDI Composition**: The use of MIDI to sequence and control sound modules and synthesizers for richer game audio.

# Production
The tools used by producers for project management are much harder to find information on as no details will leak into the source code or compiled game binaries, however, we know of a few thanks to articles in magazines such as **Develop**.

## DevTrack by TechExcel
DevTrack is TechExcel’s project issue-tracking tool, comprehensively managing issues as far reaching as new features, QA reports and IT activities. Clients include Activision, Electronic Arts, Sammy Studios, Sony Online Entertainment, Vivendi Universal.

The reason we know about this tool is thanks to issue 78 of the UK game development magazine **Develop** which had a brief section on it:
![TECHEXCEL DEVTRACK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0789c549-0dce-4838-9c22-500b0aa35285)

It was previously known as **PowerTrack** but rebranded to **DevTrack** in 1999 to focus on software development specifically.

In the February 1999 issue of EXE magazine it mentions the rebrand was at version 3.0: 
![PowerTrack rebrand](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/059f454d-af29-4ffb-bb71-9183f7fb871a)


The product is still going strong in 2025!
