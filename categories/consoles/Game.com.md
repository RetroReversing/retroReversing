## Development Kit Hardware
The only reference I can find about Tiger(dot)com development hardware is on the following page: [Tiger Game.com 101: A Beginner's Guide - RetroGaming with Racketboy](https://www.racketboy.com/retro/tiger-game-com-101-a-beginners-guide)
It says:
> Matt Scott, the owner of Byte-Size Sound, was hired as a subcontractor to create audio for specific Game(dot)com games. He later sold his development kit and software for around $700 on eBay in 2006. 

The buyer was Brandon Cobb who has an excellent website on the Game com: [The end of the game.com](https://www.diskman.com/presents/gamecom/index.html).

But sadly no images of this development kit seem to be available on the site and the eBay link will be long gone by now.
