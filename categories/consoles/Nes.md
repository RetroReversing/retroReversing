# Games

## Game Library
Despite the release of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in the early 1990s, the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) continued to maintain a substantial presence in the gaming industry.

In 1993, a surprising **55** new NES titles were released[^2], showcasing the enduring popularity of the 8-bit console. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, including the affordability of the NES, its vast existing user base, and the dedication of developers and publishers who continued to support the platform. These new NES titles provided a diverse array of gaming experiences, catering to a wide range of players and ensuring that the beloved NES had a lasting impact long after the arrival of its successor, the SNES.

## Official Retail NES Game Source Code

## Reverse Engineered NES Games
If you are interested to see existing reversing projects for the NES check out our other post specifically on this topic:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/source-code/decompiled-retail-console-games" description="For the list of decompiled games check out this post." %}

## Super Mario Bros
The original Super Mario Bros was the game that revolutionised platformers, with its smooth scrolling and excellent game design there was bound to be many reversing projects related to it. This section covers projects specifically targeted towards the classic platformer.

### Super Mario Bros Annotated Disassembly
If you are interested in how Super Mario Bros works (or to really get an insight into how any NROM Mapper 0 game works) you need to check out
[A Comprehensive Super Mario Bros. Disassembly](https://gist.github.com/1wErt3r/4048722) by **doppelganger**.

### Super Mario Compiler
The website **neilb.net** has created what it calls a **Mario Compiler** which takes in the original Super Mario Bros ROM and disassembles it.
The disassembled code is then shown to the user and can then be modified and re-assembled back into a working NES ROM. All from within the web application!

{% include link-to-other-site.html url="https://neilb.net/mariocompiler/" description="Check out the Mario compiler here" image="" title="Mario Compiler"  %}

You can also view the source code for the project here: [nbarkhina/MarioCompiler: A Super Mario Compiler written in JavaScript](https://github.com/nbarkhina/MarioCompiler)

### Super Mario Bros in C
**Mitchell Sternke** has created an impressive port of the original NES Super Mario Bros, he has written a tool that converts most of the 6502 assembly code into its equivalent C code. He has then written a PPU, Controller and APU emulation layer in C to make it all work into a portable C application running natively on the target hardware (No 6502 CPU emulation required!).

You can find it on Github here:
[SuperMarioBros-C/README.md at master Â· MitchellSternke/SuperMarioBros-C](https://github.com/MitchellSternke/SuperMarioBros-C/blob/master/README.md)

### Extracting Super Mario Bros levels in Python
Matthew Earl has an excellent post on how he managed to extract the level data for Super Mario Bros using the disassembly project and python scripts:
[Extracting Super Mario Bros levels with Python - Matt's Ramblings](http://matthewearl.github.io/2018/06/28/smb-level-extractor/)

## ROM City Rampage (Grand Theftendo)
The developers of **Retro City Rampage** (V-blank Entertainment) created a limited NES port of their game for the NES and documented some of the major changes that they needed in order to get it to run on the real console:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hvx4xXhZMrU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is a good introduction to some of the limitations you need to think about when developing a NES game.

### How to get the ROM
According to **RomHacking.net**[^1] they were not allowed to release the NES ROM created for **Grand Theftendo** or even some of the documentation that they wrote while creating it. However the ROM is in the final game, so if you own the game it is possible to extract the NES ROM and play it in an emulator!

You need to use a tool called **BFP Extractor** to extract content from: the file **gamedata.bfp** at addresses 0x747E67D6 and 0xC87FC3A3 then create a iNES ROM Header for it with the following Hex values:
```
4E 45 53 1A 20 20 50 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```
Then simply join the header with the content from address 0x747E67D6 and 0xC87FC3A3 together and name it as a .nes file.

# Hardware
In this section, we'll explore the hardware that powers the NES and how it can be reverse engineered. Understanding the hardware that drives the NES is key to unlocking its potential and gaining a deeper appreciation for the games that were developed for it.

We'll take a closer look at the different components of the NES hardware, including the CPU, PPU, and APU, and discuss how they work together to create the unique gaming experience of the NES.

## Development Kit Hardware
Since Nintendo were very new to the home video game market, they saw themselves as creating most of the software that will run on the NES.
So they did not make a public NES development kit, so most third parties has to roll their own development kits.

We have a specific post covering all the NES development kits that we know about here:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/famicom-nes-development-kit/" description="For information about Nintendo's Famicom development hardware check out this post." %}

## Retail NES Hardware
If you're interested in learning more about the hardware architecture of the NES, we highly recommend checking out the post on **Copetti.org**. This website is dedicated to exploring the technical details of the NES hardware, including the CPU, PPU, and APU, as well as other components that make up the console. You'll find in-depth explanations of how each component works, as well as detailed schematics and diagrams that help illustrate the inner workings of the NES.

{% include link-to-other-site.html url="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nes/" description="Copetti.org has an excellent tear down of the NES Hardware and how it works" image="/public/consoles/Nintendo Entertainment System.png" title="Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Architecture - A Practical Analysis" %}

## Retail NES Cartridges (Custom chips, Mappers)
Although all NES cartridges look similar from the outside apoart from a different sticker and maybe a different color cartridge casing, the internals can be vastly different from game to game.

This is especially the case in Japan where Nintendo allowed third party developers to manufacture their own cartridges, which means they could add additional microchips inside, such as custom memory mappers.

However the same wasn't the case in the west as described in this quote from [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/17964/mr-gimmick/):
> Nintendo didn't normally allow developers to use custom mapper chips in western releases, instead requiring them to reprogram their games for Nintendo's own MMC mappers. This is because Nintendo manufactured all cartridges in the west.
> Mr. Gimmick and Batman:Return of the Joker (which uses the same FME-7 mapper chip) are the only two official western NES releases to use custom mapper chips.

For emulators to support all the different cartirdge hardware, emulator authors came up with the concept of Mappers which are part of the **iNES Header** and are used by emulators to vary the emulation based on what Mapper the game ROM is defined as using.

## Retail NES Controller Electronics
<section class="postSection">
    <iframe class="wow slideInLeft postImage" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dahbvSYV0KA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<div markdown="1">
Have you ever wondered about how a NES controller actually works, such as the circuits and electronic components used to physically create it?

  Well you are in luck, the YouTuber **Displaced Gamers** explains exactly how the electronics of the NES controller works and a few interesting facts along the way!

He opens up the NES controller revealing the physical wires, traces (green lines on the circuit), rubber membranes and the 8-bit shift register (HD14021BP).

  The Controller as with all electronics has both a Power (High) and Ground (Low) lines, with 5V used for Power. Ground is connected to all of the buttons including the 4 D-pad buttons, whereas the Power lines go straight to the Carbon Printed Pull-Up resistors which then in-turn goes to each of the buttons.

  When a button is pressed it completes the circuit at that point meaning it is pulled Low (Grounded) which allows the shift register to know that button is pressed. The resistors are used to make sure the power lines are always High, so we can ensure that when a pin is pulled low it has definitely been pressed.

# Game Software Development
There was an official software development kit provided by Nintendo/Intelligent Systems for the NES/Famicom but Nintendo didn't distribute it to third party developers. Instead developers were required to either get an off-the-shelf 6502 assembler or write their own. Paired with a booklet covering how the NES handled graphics, input and sound, this was all that game developers got in terms of software for game development on the NES.

Nowadays there are many open source assemblers, IDE's and even high level language compilers that can be used to create NES homebrew games.

## How long did it take to develop games for the NES back in the day?
On average, NES game development could take anywhere from several months to a couple of years. Some simpler or shorter games might be developed more quickly, while larger, more complex titles could take longer.

Most game development teams only hand a handful of people working full time on the game, mostly programmers. Artists and Sound Engineers were often working on multiple projects at the same time. Music was usually created and added to the game near the end of the development process when the game was getting ready to be shipped.

Some examples of the length of time it took to develop Nintendo Entertainment System games are:
* **SOLAR JETMAN: HUNT FOR THE GOLDEN WARSHIP** - Took 1 year with 4 developers (but only 2 developers for 60% of development time) [^4].
* **The Portopia Serial Murder Case** and other ports by **Chunsoft** took about 4 months with a team of about 5-6 people [^5].
* **Guevara/Guerrilla War** by SNK was ported from the arcade original in just two months by the main programmer Yukio Kaneda. This was an agreement in which he would accept the short deadline in return for being allowed to add a hidden minigame based on the orignal SNK game **Sasuke vs. Commander** [^9]

## Who was the first NES game developers outside of Japan?
The British company **Rare** made gaming history by becoming the first non-Japanese licensed game developer for the NES, securing the license from Nintendo through an ingenious demonstration of their skills by reverse engineering the console and showcasing the game "Slalom" as a convincing demo to Nintendo in 1986 [^3].

They created their own development kits based on the PDS and you can find out more about it in our post on the NES Development Hardware:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/famicom-nes-development-kit/" description="For information about Nintendo's Famicom development hardware check out this post." %}

## What do we know about the Official Famicom SDK?
The Official Famicom SDK was created by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems in 1986, as revealed by a file leaked in the Nintendo Gigaleaks. The file, called `HDT.EXE`, was included with the source code to the Game Boy Zelda game.

It contains the NES/Famicom Debugger, a tool developed by Intelligent Systems between 1986-1989, which appears to read in three file formats: CHR (Character/Tile Data), SCR (Screen data or Source Data), and CGD (possibly standing for Character Graphic Designer, though this is uncertain).

## What is a NES emulator and how does it work?
We have a specific post covering exactly how emulators work including tips for writing your own emulators:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/how-emulators-work" description="For more information on how emulators work check out this post." %}

## When was the first NES emulator?
We have a specific post on the history of NES emulation:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/nes-emulation" description="For more information on the history of NES emulators check out this post." %}


## NES Emulators with Debugging Functionality
When reversing or developing NES games it is vital to use a good emulator which has debugging support such as:
* **BreakPoints** - e.g can create a breakpoint at a specific code or memory location and execution will stop at that place
* **Symbol File support** - e.g supports loading a file with a list of known variable and function names
* **Built-in Assembler** - assemble code in real-time within the emulator to quickly create patches
* **PPU Viewer** - see the current state of the Picture Processing Unit such as the Nametable, Sprites, CHR Memory viewer etc

Here is a list of a few Open Source emulators that have some of these features:
* **Mesen** - [SourMesen/Mesen: Mesen is a cross-platform (Windows & Linux) NES/Famicom emulator built in C++ and C#](https://github.com/SourMesen/Mesen)
* **Nintendulator** - [quietust/nintendulator: NES emulator for Windows](https://github.com/quietust/nintendulator)

## Writing 6502 NES Assembly
The best 6502 Assembly tutorial for the NES has to be **Brian Parker's** Nerdy Nights tutorial series which goes from the basics all the way up to writing a version of pong! The original posts have been taken down but you can find a mirror here: [Nerdy Nights Mirror](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science/#main_tutorial-0)

## How are games so small (40KB)?
The game developer **Morphcat Games** has released a video on how they created an impressive game called **Micro Mages** in just 40KB without using a mapper (NROM board):
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWQ0591PAxM?si=x6hKn2GerV5wqSSg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It mentioned Metatiles and tehcniques for oiptimizing tile usage (removing duplicates and using mirroring).

# Game Modding and ROM Hacking
By modifying the code, graphics, or sound of an NES game, you can create new levels, characters, or even entirely new games that build upon the classic gameplay and aesthetics of the original. This can provide a unique and personalized gaming experience that is tailored to your own interests and preferences.

Additionally, modding NES games can be a great way to learn more about the technical aspects of game development and programming, as well as to connect with other enthusiasts in the retro gaming community.

## Tonkachi Editor (Hammer Editor)
![Tonkachi Editor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b346317-a9fb-4236-9d75-1535f7a920ec)

Released on the 1st July 1987 by **I-2 Co. Ltd** [^6] the Tonkachi Editor was a Famicom Disk System Disk which allowed editing of other Famicom Disk System games. This is the earliest ROM Hacking software we are aware of and was sold in retail stores in Japan.

This was years before the first Game Genie's were released and it was far more powerful than any chat cartirdge that was ever released in the west.

### How did Tonkachi Editor work?
Since Famicom Disk system games were written on re-writeable **Quick Disks** all the software needed to do was load itself into memory, ask the user to put the game they want to modify in and then allow the user to change bytes in HEX or ASCII format before writing the game out to a free slot on the card.

Although it was quite cumbersome as in order to test out the changes you would need to write the card and reboot the system into the written game. So some people used multiple Disk systems, so they could keep the Tonkachi Editor editor running on one of them and test out the changes on the other, without the constant restarting [^6].

### What documentation did Tonkachi Editor come with?
It came with a rather beefy 63 page manual in A5 format, printed in black and white. Apparently it even teaches some basic 6502 assembly language [^6]! It even documented how the original Super Mario Bros worked (although it is inaccurate), that would become the basis of our deep understanding of the game to this day.

### Did Tonkachi Editor come with any ROM Hacks built in?
Yes there was a ROM hack of the original Super Mario Bros called **Hammer Mario** which may be one of the first ROM hacks ever created! [^6].

### Did Tonkachi Editor support cartridge based games?
Yes cartridge games were supported (on the twin fami) but only up to 320kb could be transfered on to the disk cards so when Nintendo started releasing larger cartridge based games they could not be edited [^8].

### The Tonkachi Editor magazines/news/booklets
![Hammer News](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3976c9-c001-4649-ad28-adbd87bbcf7b)

Similar to cheat books that were published for cheat cartridges there was a magazine produced called the **Hammer News**, it had 6 volumes and was created by users writing in to **i2** with their own findings modifying Famicom Disk System (and even ROM cartridges).

## Quick Hunter Parameter Software (Game Analyzer Group Club)
![Quick Hunter Box](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de9d460-c9ae-457f-8f0b-fcd625850c7e)

Despite the success of **Tonkachi Editor** no other companies created competitors, the only thing that came close was the **Quick Hunter Parameter software** (ã¯ã¤ãã¯ãã³ã¿ã¼) for the Famicom Disk System [^6].

![Quick Hunter Menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c1928ce-d315-499c-a5d4-daf59a6a48af)

It's not quite clear what the **Quick Hunter Parameter software** actually did, but since Quick Hunter itself was a illegal Disk copier, presumably the **Parameter Disks** allowed some minor modifications such as a cheat code to be inserted.

There was at least 3 Parameter software disks released in japan [^7].

Although I can only find photos of the main software and two parameter disks:
![Parameter Disks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cfd0c4a-b97a-4451-9c9d-3ec9e1008e61)

## Game Genie Cheat Cartridges (1990+)
The main cheat cartridge available for the NES was the **Game Genie** created by **Codemasters** (Distributed by Galoob & Hornby Hobbies). This was a physical connector that would sit between the NES and the Game Cartridge you wanted to cheat on. It would alter the signals based on which memory addresses were being read/written to in real-time based on the Cheat code that was loaded into the system.

### Game Genie Code Format
The Game Genie used a special encoding format for its codes which can be encoded and decoded using this handy online tool:
[Game Genie Encoder/Decoder](https://games.technoplaza.net/ggencoder/js/)

### Making Game Genie Codes Permanent
If you want to permanently modify one of your NES ROM files with a certain cheat code there is a Windows Only tool to do this created by **rdurbin**:
[Romhacking.net - Utilities - Permanent Game Genie](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/784/)

## NES Memory Corruption
Corrupting the memory of a ROM has become very popular over on Youtube with creators such as **Vinesauce** regularly using ROM corruptors on popular games to produce some interesting results.

If you want to try it yourself we recommend the **Real-Time Corruptor Vanguard** (RTCV) available on Github: [redscientistlabs/RTCV: Real-Time Corruptor, Vanguard, CorruptCore, NetCore2 https://redscientist.com/rtc](https://github.com/redscientistlabs/RTCV). It is written using DotNet so it should work on Windows and MacOSX/Linux via Mono.

For more information we have a specific post on the topic of Game memory corruption:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/emulator-game-memory-corruption" description="For information about Game Memory Corruption check out this post." %}

### Deliberate NES Memory Corruption by Javidx9
The Youtuber **Javidx9** has created a system that randomly corrupts the memory of a NES game (every 5 seconds) as it runs just for the fun of seeing the chaos that follows. The interesting part of this is that his system is somewhat smart in that it tracks the most common memory addresses used per frame (excluding screen memory) and changes those at a higher rate compared to just random memory locations.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-csXgGstvHg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Apparently the source code was once linked on the twitch page, but it is sadly so old now that the link has disappeared, it would have been really interesting to see it!

## HD Texture Packs
You can easily replace the 2D Sprites and Tiles from a NES game with HD/4K alternatives using specific emulators such as Mesen and HDNes. The gameplay is unchanged as it overlays the HD Graphics on top of the game and doesn't have any of the colour limitations of the NES hardware. These modifications as emulator specific and will not modify the original ROM.

Mesen even comes with a HD Pack Builder Tool to create your own texture packs, for more information: [HD Packs :: Mesen Documentation](https://www.mesen.ca/docs/hdpacks.html#using-the-hd-pack-builder)

# Graphics & Rendering
For an introduction to how the NES renders graphics to the screen checkout **Austin Morlan**'s excellent article on his website:
[An Overview of NES Rendering - Austin Morlan](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/nes_rendering_overview/).

It covers the following topics related to NES Graphics:
* **Tiles** - 8x8 pixel graphics used to make up the background of a game
* **Block** - A set of 4x4 tiles (used for colour indexing)
* **Frames** - Background made up of 32x30 titles (256x240 pixels)
* **Nametable** - Big blob of bytes, specifying which tile is placed where in the frame (Like a Room in GameMaker)
* **Pattern Table** - Contains the actual pixels for the 8x8 tiles as either a 1 or a 0 (no colour information)
* **System Palette** - A Palette of all the 64 colours a NES can output to the screen
* **Frame Palette** - A dynamic subset of the System Palette of just the colours used in a single frame. Palette 0 to 3 are for background tiles, and 4 to 7 are for sprites.
* **Attribute Table** - A look up table of which Palette to use for that Block (set of 4x4 tiles)
* **Sprites** - Graphics made up of tiles but are rendered above the background tiles

# Reverse Engineering
If you're interested in exploring the inner workings of classic video games, reverse engineering is a process that can help you uncover the secrets of how these games were designed and programmed. In this tutorial, we'll provide an overview of the techniques used to reverse engineer NES games, including disassembly, debugging, and memory analysis

## File Formats
When reversing NES games you will come across a variety of file formats, this section will try to cover all of the most common formats you will encounter.

The formats for NES ROMS (virtual cartridges) are:
* **.NES** - This is the most common format for NES ROMs to be in, it is also known as the **iNES** format, most emulators will play this format (For More information: [INES - NESdev Wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/INES))
* **.UNIF** - The Universal NES Image Format was a competitor format to iNES 1.0 but has largely been replaced by iNES 2.0
* **.FDS** - Famicom Disc System backup format created for the **fwNES** emulator
* **.NSF** (NSF2/NSFe) - NES Sound Format for playing music ripped from NES games can be played back in some emulators and specific NSF tools.
* **.TNES** - Official Format by Nintendo used on the 3DS Virtual Console and also supports Famicom Disc System games

## Tutorial - Adding Hard Drops to NES Tetris
The website **Grid Bugs** has written an excellent article on reverse engineering the NES version of Tetris to add functionality to the game called a **Hard Drop**. Check it out here:

## Nestadia CTF - Reversing a Cloud-based NES Emulator
The security blog **segfault.me** has an excellent write-up of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge called **Nestadia**. The challenge involved reverse engineering a cloud-based NES emulator to find a flag hidden inside a game's ROM. It is a fascinating read on a modern twist to classic NES hacking.
{% include link-to-other-site.html url="https://segfault.me/2021/05/26/northsec-2021-writeup-nestadia-part-1/" description="Check out the Nestadia CTF Writeup here" image="" title="NorthSec 2021 Writeup: Nestadia Part 1"  %}

## Emulating NES games in Ghidra with pCode
Ghidra uses pcode as an intermediate representation of machine code, enabling more abstract analysis and manipulation of binary instructions across different processor architectures during the reverse engineering process.

Ghidra provides a built-in emulator that can execute pcode, which has been put to good use in the [ghidra-plays-mario Github project](https://github.com/nevesnunes/ghidra-plays-mario?tab=readme-ov-file). Where they have taken the cpu emulation out of **smolnes** emulator and replaced it with the Ghidra pcode emulation and it plays the first level of Mario!

This isn't a realistic way to play the game, it uses pre-recorded inputs, but it is an excellent want to test Ghidra's `pcode` emulation! Allowing bugs to be found which when fixed will benefit all NES reversing projects.
