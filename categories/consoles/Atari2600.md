The first games for the Atari 2600 were developed on the **JOLT** which was a low-cost 6502 computer, in fact the original prototype for the Atari 2600 was based on a Jolt computer with hand wired modification and joysticks from the arcade version of the TANK arcade game [^1].

For more information about the JOLT check out this page:

### US Gold Atari 7800 Development kit
In the UK magazine **Zero** issue 7 there is an interview with the game developer **US Gold** where it mentions they are working on Atari 7800 games such as Gauntlet and it gives a brief description of the Development Kit they are using:
> The 7800 development kit comprises the following: a Mega ST running Atari's proprietary combination 6502/68000 assembler, lead from ST to 7800 RAM cartridge and downloading software [^2].
