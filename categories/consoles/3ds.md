## Project Citrus (CTR)
During development the Nintendo 3DS has the codename Project Citrus (CTR) which was the follow up to Nintendo's very popular DS (NITRO) and DSi (TWL) handheld video game consoles. It was fairly successful in the market but became their last handheld-only console as they switched to the hybrid model for the Nintendo Switch. 

## Early Days Of 3DS Hacking
The Youtube channel **Tech Rules** has made an excellent video explaining how the Nintendo 3DS was initially jailbroken, using a "terrible game".
