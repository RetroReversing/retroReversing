### mm-explained: Maniac Mansion C64 Disassembly
[pditincho](https://github.com/pditincho/mm-explained) has produced a reconstructed and fully commented disassembly of the Commodore 64 implementation of Maniac Mansion. This project documents the inner workings of the engine's C64 iteration, covering 6502 assembly routines, specialized disk loaders, and hardware-level interactions with the VIC-II and SID chips. It provides a detailed technical breakdown of game entities such as rooms, costumes, and scripts, serving as a comprehensive resource for understanding the game's original architecture.
