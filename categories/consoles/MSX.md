# Introduction
Welcome to our page dedicated to MSX reverse engineering!

On this page, we've compiled a list of links to other pages that cover various topics related to MSX reverse engineering. Whether you're interested in understanding the hardware architecture of retro CPUs, analyzing software at the binary level, or exploring the many mods and hacks that have been created by enthusiasts over the years, you'll find a wealth of resources and information on the pages we've linked to. 

So grab your keyboard and mouse, and get ready to dive into the exciting world of MSX reverse engineering!

# MSX
The MSX was a standard introducted by **Microsoft Japan** to make sure no matter which manufacturer build the PC (e.g Sony, Panasonic, Philips) they would all be able to run the same software.

The MSX has a version of BASIC built in which was an extended version of Microsoft Basic, hence the **MSX** name [^1].

There were three different revisions of the MSX:
* MSX
* MSX2
* MSX Turbo R

## Introduction to the technology of the MSX
The best video I have found on the MSX is by the Youtuber **Displaced Gamers** where he goes through all the variations of the MSX (MSX2 etc) and explains the hardware limitations and the impressive feats developers managed to accomplish on the systems:

## MSX Games
While the MSX system is most famous for Konami games like Vampire Killer (Castlevania) and Metal Gear there are quite a few games worth playing for the system. What better video to show off the MSX games than the **Game Sack** episode on the topic:

## Sony MSX Hardware
Way before the PlayStation or even the Super Nintendo CD, Sony created hardware for playing games in the form of MSX computers [^1]. 
Sony released their HIT-BIT machines which started with the HB-10 which had 16KB of RAM and ranged all the way up to the MSX 2 compatible HB-T600 with 128KB RAM [^2].
